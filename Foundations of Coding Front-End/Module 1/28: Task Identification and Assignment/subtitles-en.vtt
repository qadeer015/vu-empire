2
00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:09.961
From regular stand-ups to debugging,

3
00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:14.496
front-end developers must perform
various tasks to bring websites to life!

4
00:00:14.496 --> 00:00:17.390
In this video,
we will identify essential tasks and

5
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.070
their roles in front-end development.

6
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.031
The core task of a front-end
developer is writing code, but

7
00:00:23.031 --> 00:00:27.280
writing good code requires collaboration
with other members of the team.

8
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.702
Let's explore how tasks like stand-ups and
code reviews can help a front-end

9
00:00:31.702 --> 00:00:35.680
developer collaborate with
others to write better code.

10
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.204
Stand-ups are short, daily meetings where
the team members update each other

11
00:00:40.204 --> 00:00:42.960
on their progress and obstacles.

12
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.618
Stand-ups are vital because they keep
the team aligned in the project and

13
00:00:46.618 --> 00:00:48.720
increase team awareness.

14
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.090
They also promote transparency and
accountability among team members.

15
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.434
Daily stand-ups also allow
team members to raise issues,

16
00:00:56.434 --> 00:00:59.530
helping to keep the project on track.

17
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.777
Stand-ups are useful for

18
00:01:00.777 --> 00:01:03.970
making sure you're regularly
interacting with your team.

19
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.552
It's a part of how web application
developers work with others to keep

20
00:01:07.552 --> 00:01:10.970
the production of
the website moving forward.

21
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.203
Stand-ups are great for
fostering regular communication, but

22
00:01:14.203 --> 00:01:17.860
the work gets done when the team
is working collaboratively.

23
00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.380
Let's explore how development
depends on collaboration.

24
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.688
The front-end of a web application has
many components that require a diverse set

25
00:01:26.688 --> 00:01:28.460
of skills to develop.

26
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.356
Graphic designers create the visuals,
data engineers create the data model and

27
00:01:33.356 --> 00:01:34.916
storage components,

28
00:01:34.916 --> 00:01:38.971
web developers write the code and
implement the graphic designer's visuals,

29
00:01:38.971 --> 00:01:43.027
and marketing and sales strategists
influence the application's features by

30
00:01:43.027 --> 00:01:45.800
being the voice of the customer.

31
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.460
All of these roles need to work
together to make a unified product.

32
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.113
Collaboration when building a front-end
web application means working closely with

33
00:01:55.113 --> 00:01:58.600
designers, back-end developers and
other team members.

34
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.135
Designers and
developers share their work and

35
00:02:01.135 --> 00:02:05.280
use shared design tools like
Figma to keep things consistent.

36
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.049
Using systems like GitHub helps
the team share code changes and

37
00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:10.950
keep everyone up to date.

38
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.270
Regular code checks ensure quality.

39
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.636
When a team works collaboratively, they
use the expertise of each discipline to

40
00:02:18.636 --> 00:02:23.630
solve problems, and they incorporate
user feedback to improve the product.

41
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.437
Working together in this way ensures
the final product is well-made and

42
00:02:27.437 --> 00:02:29.670
meets everyone's needs.

43
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.555
Effective collaboration ensures
that the design, functionality, and

44
00:02:33.555 --> 00:02:36.800
user experience are all aligned and
optimized.

45
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.363
For example, a designer might create a
design in Figma and share it with the web

46
00:02:41.363 --> 00:02:46.840
developer, who uses the information in the
Figma file to create the user interface.

47
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.967
This type of collaboration helps the team
align the design with what the user will

48
00:02:50.967 --> 00:02:52.560
experience.

49
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.133
The web development team must collaborate
extensively to move from a visual

50
00:02:57.133 --> 00:02:58.880
design to code.

51
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.160
That's where code reviews come in.

52
00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.224
Code reviews help you improve
the quality of the code you write.

53
00:03:04.224 --> 00:03:07.901
Code reviews are evaluations
of code by other developers to

54
00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:13.030
ensure it meets the quality standards and
adheres to best practices.

55
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.848
This collaborative process
helps catch errors and

56
00:03:15.848 --> 00:03:18.950
improve the overall
quality of the codebase.

57
00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.693
Code reviews help developers improve and
maintain code quality, reduce bugs, and

58
00:03:23.693 --> 00:03:27.110
facilitate knowledge
sharing among team members.

59
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.953
For example, you might discover a more
efficient way to write a piece of code

60
00:03:30.953 --> 00:03:35.390
during a code review, which can
then be applied across the project.

61
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.426
Now that we've covered collaborative
meetings in which developers participate,

62
00:03:39.426 --> 00:03:42.414
let's explore how developers
manage their code changes.

63
00:03:42.414 --> 00:03:44.670
This is called "source control".

64
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.910
Effective source control is
key to a smooth workflow.

65
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.692
Source control is
the practice of managing and

66
00:03:51.692 --> 00:03:55.510
tracking changes to code
using tools like GitHub.

67
00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.311
Managing code using source control tools
helps teams coordinate work among multiple

68
00:04:00.311 --> 00:04:03.850
developers and
maintain a history of changes.

69
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.398
Source control helps prevent conflicts
when multiple developers work on

70
00:04:08.398 --> 00:04:13.090
the same project by keeping track of all
changes each of them makes.

71
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.410
Source control can manage changes
to one file by multiple developers.

72
00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.849
Source control tools also maintain
a history of all the changes, so

73
00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:26.910
if someone makes a mistake, you can easily
go back to a previous version of the code.

74
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.758
Developers use GitHub and similar tools
to manage and track code changes.

75
00:04:31.758 --> 00:04:35.757
Imagine this case,
you've added a new front-end feature, but

76
00:04:35.757 --> 00:04:37.875
it causes an unexpected problem.

77
00:04:37.875 --> 00:04:41.806
With source control, you can quickly return
to the version before the feature was

78
00:04:41.806 --> 00:04:45.570
added, allowing you to fix the issue
without having to start from scratch.

79
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.947
Managing source control sets the stage for
the next task: Merging code.

80
00:04:50.947 --> 00:04:54.614
Let's learn how front-end
developers integrate their changes

81
00:04:54.614 --> 00:04:56.960
into the main codebase.

82
00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.464
When developers use source control to
merge code, they integrate changes from

83
00:05:01.464 --> 00:05:05.400
different branches or
versions into the main codebase.

84
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.884
After the code is merged,

85
00:05:06.884 --> 00:05:10.260
all contributions from the team
are combined seamlessly.

86
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.640
Merging code helps developers by
integrating updates into the project.

87
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.647
As a developer working on different parts
of the front-end, you'll spend time at

88
00:05:20.647 --> 00:05:24.040
the beginning or end of each day
merging everyone's contributions.

89
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.140
Merging also helps developers
prevent code conflicts.

90
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.076
If two developers work on the same code,
conflicts can occur, but

91
00:05:33.076 --> 00:05:37.520
managing work items and proper merging
practices can prevent conflicts.

92
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.659
Developers combine their individual
changes into the main project so

93
00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:44.660
all updates are included.

94
00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.857
This practice helps front-end
developers maintain a unified and

95
00:05:47.857 --> 00:05:49.940
up-to-date codebase.

96
00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.113
Merging code keeps all
developers' daily work in sync, so

97
00:05:53.113 --> 00:05:57.300
they can spend more of their
time writing and debugging code.

98
00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.660
Next, let's explore this
task in more detail.

99
00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.663
When developing a front-end for
a web application,

100
00:06:03.663 --> 00:06:07.740
some developers use three primary
technologies or languages.

101
00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.462
First, Hyper Text Markup Language, or
HTML, is used as the coding language to

102
00:06:12.462 --> 00:06:17.400
create standard user interface elements,
like buttons, backgrounds, and text.

103
00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.171
Next, developers use another technology
called Cascading Style Sheets or

104
00:06:23.171 --> 00:06:27.095
CSS to modify the visual attributes
of the elements like color,

105
00:06:27.095 --> 00:06:30.040
rounded corners, and specific fonts.

106
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:34.320
Finally, JavaScript is used to
make the front-end interactive.

107
00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.255
Developers use these three technologies
together to create appealing,

108
00:06:38.255 --> 00:06:40.640
dynamic application front ends.

109
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.581
For example, if a developer wants to
create a button that adds items to a cart

110
00:06:44.581 --> 00:06:45.751
in a web application,

111
00:06:45.751 --> 00:06:49.600
they'll use HTML to create a simple
button on the user interface.

112
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:54.508
If they want the button to appear blue
with a Sans serif font with the words

113
00:06:54.508 --> 00:06:58.160
"Add to cart" on it,
they'll use CSS to style it.

114
00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.646
Finally, they write JavaScript code that
responds when a user selects the button on

115
00:07:02.646 --> 00:07:04.120
the page.

116
00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:08.039
Web developers work to write clean,
efficient code and catch and

117
00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:10.720
fix any issues as they're writing.

118
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.480
However, even the most careful
developers won't find every problem.

119
00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.400
They must continually check for
new issues called bugs.

120
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.880
Let's examine how developers handle
this through regular bug checks.

121
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.104
Checking for bugs, or

122
00:07:24.104 --> 00:07:28.208
debugging code, involves testing
the website to identify any issues

123
00:07:28.208 --> 00:07:33.360
that need to be fixed before the web
application is made available to users.

124
00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:39.240
This process verifies that the website
works properly and doesn't produce errors.

125
00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:43.718
By debugging their code, developers ensure
that users have a stable, secure, and

126
00:07:43.718 --> 00:07:47.360
productive experience
with their application.

127
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:52.152
A web application that is as close to bug-
free as possible gives the users the best

128
00:07:52.152 --> 00:07:53.020
experience.

129
00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.006
Developers regularly test their
code to identify and fix new bugs,

130
00:07:58.006 --> 00:08:00.952
which helps maintain
a smooth user experience.

131
00:08:00.952 --> 00:08:02.476
By continuously testing,

132
00:08:02.476 --> 00:08:06.060
you can ensure that new updates
don't introduce new problems.

133
00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:14.536
In this video, you learned to identify
key tasks in front-end development,

134
00:08:14.536 --> 00:08:18.512
including attending stand-ups,
participating in code reviews,

135
00:08:18.512 --> 00:08:21.778
managing source control,
merging code from GitHub,

136
00:08:21.778 --> 00:08:25.650
writing and debugging code,
and checking for new bugs.

137
00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:30.191
We also explored how our web developers
create a seamless user experience through

138
00:08:30.191 --> 00:08:33.989
close collaboration with designers and
developers.

139
00:08:33.989 --> 00:08:36.552
By working collaboratively
with their team and

140
00:08:36.552 --> 00:08:39.372
following a disciplined
approach to development,

141
00:08:39.372 --> 00:08:43.870
web developers can build speedy, secure
applications that delight their users.

142
00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:44.370
