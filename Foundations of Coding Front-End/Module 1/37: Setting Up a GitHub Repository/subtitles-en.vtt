00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.380
Source control repositories are one of a software developer's most important tools.

2
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.359
GitHub is a popular repository that has a large community that supports it.

3
00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:16.020
In this video, we're going to set up a GitHub repository.

4
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.739
This will include setting up an account, creating your first repository, creating your first

5
00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:24.540
file, and then cloning the repository with GitHub Desktop.

6
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.819
Let's get started.

7
00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:31.059
To set up an account on GitHub, I'll browse to https.github.com.

8
00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:35.139
This is the online portal to GitHub where you can do almost anything you need to do

9
00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:38.380
in the repository, including writing code.

10
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.939
I'll use the portal to set up an account and create a repository.

11
00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:49.580
Next, I'll select the Sign Up button from the upper menu to begin the sign up process.

12
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.939
Users need an active email address to sign up for GitHub.

13
00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:57.180
I'll enter my email address and then select Continue.

14
00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.540
Now I'll create a unique password.

15
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.979
GitHub has some password requirements that I'll need to meet, and I can't use any part

16
00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:05.459
of my username in the password.

17
00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:09.180
Once I have a password I like, I'll write it down somewhere safe so I don't forget it

18
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.139
and then select Continue.

19
00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:14.239
Now I'll create my username.

20
00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:17.739
My username is how I'll be recognized by others on GitHub.

21
00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:22.319
This is particularly important when you're working with teams on GitHub.

22
00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:26.000
My username will need to be unique on GitHub, so I'll create something meaningful but not

23
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.599
too simple.

24
00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:31.519
Once I've created a unique username, I'll select Continue.

25
00:01:31.519 --> 00:01:35.239
While I'm welcome to sign up for email from GitHub if I'd like, for this example I'll

26
00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:40.400
leave the email preferences box unchecked and then select Continue.

27
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.279
For security reasons, GitHub wants to make sure an automated machine isn't creating the

28
00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:48.639
account, so it will ask me to solve a few simple puzzles to verify that a real person

29
00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:50.279
is signing up.

30
00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:56.839
I'll start this process by selecting Verify, then following the prompts GitHub presents.

31
00:01:56.839 --> 00:02:00.800
Once I've completed the verification process, I'm just about done.

32
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.360
GitHub wants to make sure I have a valid and active email account, so after the validation

33
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.720
check, it will automatically send me an email with an 8-digit number it calls the launch

34
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.720
code.

35
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.240
When the email arrives, I'll enter the launch code in the boxes provided.

36
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.600
A successful launch code will take me to the sign-in page.

37
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.759
Now I'm ready to sign into my new account.

38
00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:23.119
I'll use the credentials I created earlier.

39
00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:27.759
I'll enter my username or email address, I can use either, and my password in the boxes

40
00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:30.880
provided and then I'll select Sign In.

41
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:37.039
If all goes well, GitHub will take me to the Welcome page where I can personalize my experience.

42
00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:41.199
For this walkthrough, I'll skip personalization by selecting the Skip Personalization link

43
00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:43.199
at the bottom of the page.

44
00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:49.399
I'll then continue to the GitHub interface where I can create my first repository.

45
00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:51.559
Repositories can be public or private.

46
00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:56.080
A private repository is one that only I can use, while public repositories are visible

47
00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.520
to anyone on the internet.

48
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.919
The private repository is selected by default and I'll keep that option selected.

49
00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:07.679
It's best practice to create a README file that is available on your repository's landing

50
00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:12.360
page, so select Create in the README section.

51
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.520
I'll create a simple README that says this is my first repository.

52
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.320
The file is a markdown file, which is a markup format for creating styles and text documents,

53
00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.479
but I'll just add plain text without any markup.

54
00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:28.679
When I'm done with my changes, I'll select Commit Changes.

55
00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:33.679
Committing Changes stores the README in a new GitHub repository.

56
00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:37.559
When you commit a file or files to GitHub, it's best practice to add a description of

57
00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:41.800
what you changed so other developers can know what's new in the file.

58
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.320
I'll add a description for the README commit and then select Commit Change.

59
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.460
To see the README in my repository, I'll select Code from the tab bar.

60
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.800
Be aware that there's a button and a tab that both say Code.

61
00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.759
For this activity, I'm selecting the code Tab.

62
00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:04.360
This tab shows me all the code in my repository and gives me options for managing my repository.

63
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.279
At this point, the repository only exists on GitHub.com.

64
00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:12.240
This is helpful, but GitHub enables me to create a clone of this repository on my computer

65
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.760
so I can work independently and update the online repository only when I want to.

66
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.959
This is most useful when developers are working in teams.

67
00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.760
Now that I have the repository set up and the README in it, I'll clone it locally so

68
00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.640
I can edit the file on my computer.

69
00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.480
I'm going to use the GitHub Desktop tool to manage this process.

70
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.239
Select the Code button to reveal the options for cloning the repository.

71
00:04:37.239 --> 00:04:40.640
You'll notice the option for GitHub Desktop.

72
00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.760
Selecting the GitHub Desktop option will take us to the tool's home page.

73
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.320
From there, we can download and install the tool.

74
00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.920
I'm going to select Download Now to download and install the tool.

75
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.799
After the tool installs, it will display the splash screen where you can sign in to GitHub.

76
00:04:57.799 --> 00:05:03.480
I'll select Sign into GitHub.com to start the sign-in process.

77
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.320
GitHub Desktop takes me to an authorization screen where I can give it permission to use

78
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.359
my GitHub account.

79
00:05:09.359 --> 00:05:14.799
I'll select Continue to proceed to the Authorization Options screen.

80
00:05:14.799 --> 00:05:19.399
The Authorize GitHub Desktop page allows me to customize the permissions I give to GitHub

81
00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:20.399
Desktop.

82
00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:24.559
I'm going to leave everything at the defaults and select Authorize Desktop to finish the

83
00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:26.839
authorization process.

84
00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:32.000
This will take me back to GitHub Desktop where I can finish the configuration.

85
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.559
The tool automatically selects the option to use my GitHub account information, so I'll

86
00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:39.920
leave that selected and then select Finish to complete the setup.

87
00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.920
Now I'm ready to clone my repository to my local hard disk.

88
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:49.399
Because I signed in to GitHub and authorized GitHub Desktop to use my account, the tool

89
00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:54.040
automatically provides me with the repositories I have on GitHub.

90
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.720
When I select the repository I created earlier, GitHub Desktop gives me the option to clone

91
00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.559
it to my local disk.

92
00:06:00.559 --> 00:06:04.320
I'll select the button to clone my online repository.

93
00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.480
GitHub Desktop takes me to the Clone screen and has selected and pre-filled items on the

94
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.160
URL tab.

95
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.679
I'll leave all values to the defaults except for the location on my local disk where I

96
00:06:13.679 --> 00:06:15.720
want to clone the repository.

97
00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:20.040
I already created a development folder on my computer, so I'm going to type that into

98
00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.799
the Local Path text box.

99
00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:26.720
GitHub automatically will create a subfolder for the repository.

100
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.399
With the folder location set, I'll select Clone to start the cloning process.

101
00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:35.399
This will copy the repository from GitHub to my local machine.

102
00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:39.279
GitHub Desktop provides me with a status page as it downloads the files to the folder I

103
00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:40.720
selected.

104
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.519
When the download is complete, it will take me to the main GitHub Desktop interface where

105
00:06:44.519 --> 00:06:46.920
I can interact with the repository.

106
00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.640
GitHub Desktop's left pane lets me know if any files have changed.

107
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.519
The right pane gives you the options for opening your repository so you can review the files

108
00:06:54.519 --> 00:06:57.399
in it and edit them if necessary.

109
00:06:57.399 --> 00:07:02.000
Since I just cloned the repository, the GitHub Desktop doesn't have any files that have changed.

110
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.839
I'm going to open the repository in my File Manager.

111
00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:10.679
I'll select Show in Explorer to open the repository in Windows Explorer where I'll be able to

112
00:07:10.679 --> 00:07:16.640
review the files which, for now, only include the README that I created earlier.

113
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:22.119
Notice that the folder includes the README.md file but also a .git folder.

114
00:07:22.119 --> 00:07:28.760
This folder contains files that the Git technology uses to maintain information about the repository.

115
00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.519
You should rarely need to work with any of the files in this folder and can ignore them.

116
00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:34.959
If this folder doesn't appear for you, don't worry.

117
00:07:34.959 --> 00:07:39.679
It's there but it's hidden and still can be used to manage your repository.

118
00:07:39.679 --> 00:07:42.640
Now I'll edit the README file using Notepad.

119
00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:46.119
Although it has a markdown extension, it's a plain text file so you can make changes

120
00:07:46.119 --> 00:07:49.799
using editors like Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on Mac.

121
00:07:49.799 --> 00:07:55.600
I'll right-click on the README.md file and select Edit in Notepad to open the file.

122
00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:00.559
You'll notice that the content of the README is exactly the same as when I created it on GitHub.

123
00:08:00.559 --> 00:08:06.359
This is because when you clone a repository, it copies the files exactly as they are.

124
00:08:06.359 --> 00:08:10.079
Then when you make changes, GitHub is aware of them and will allow you to synchronize

125
00:08:10.079 --> 00:08:12.720
your changes with the repository in GitHub.

126
00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.720
I'll make a change to this file and show how that works.

127
00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:22.600
I'll add a new line, this is my first edit, to the README and then select Save from the File menu.

128
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.799
Now that I've saved the file, GitHub is aware that it has been updated.

129
00:08:26.799 --> 00:08:29.920
I'll close the file in Notepad since I'm done updating it.

130
00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.239
Now I'll return to the GitHub Desktop application.

131
00:08:32.239 --> 00:08:35.640
Notice that the interface is updated automatically.

132
00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:41.039
The left pane tells me that the README has changed and the tool updates me with the changes in the right pane.

133
00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:44.919
I can even compare each line in the original with those in the changed version.

134
00:08:45.039 --> 00:08:50.520
At this point, the change is only on my local disk and technically isn't in the repository yet.

135
00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:55.880
GitHub has noticed that the change has been made, but now I need to commit it to the repository.

136
00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.440
Once I commit it, it will be in the cloned repository in my local disk,

137
00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:03.159
but won't be in the repository on github.com yet.

138
00:09:03.159 --> 00:09:05.640
First, I'll commit it to my local repository.

139
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.919
In the description field, I'll write a note about what's changed,

140
00:09:07.919 --> 00:09:11.200
just as I did when I first created the README file.

141
00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.400
Then I'll select Commit to Main.

142
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.559
When I commit the file to my repository,

143
00:09:16.559 --> 00:09:21.559
GitHub Desktop indicates that there are no more changes in my local repository.

144
00:09:21.559 --> 00:09:24.960
But it also indicates that the changes I just committed to my local repository

145
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:30.760
are ready to be pushed to the origin, which is the place from which I cloned the repository.

146
00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.679
In this case, the origin is my repository on github.com.

147
00:09:34.679 --> 00:09:39.960
I'll select Push to Origin to update the remote repository with my change.

148
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.599
GitHub Desktop informs me that it's pushing the changes to the README

149
00:09:43.599 --> 00:09:48.799
to the repository on github.com and lets me know when it's done.

150
00:09:48.799 --> 00:09:50.799
Now I'll return to github.com.

151
00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.400
Notice that the README file on the remote repository

152
00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.440
reflects the changes I made on my local machine.

153
00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.440
GitHub is a powerful way to maintain a record of your development file

154
00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.000
so you can track changes over time

155
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.080
and have your files in multiple locations if something goes wrong.

156
00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.520
But what if you have files in your local folder repository

157
00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.960
that you don't want to sync with your repository?

158
00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.840
GitHub is a way to manage that too.

159
00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.719
By creating a special file called gitignore,

160
00:10:18.719 --> 00:10:21.320
you can tell GitHub not to pay attention to certain files

161
00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:25.159
so any changes you make to them won't be updated to GitHub.

162
00:10:25.159 --> 00:10:27.799
I'm going to return to my local repository in Windows Explorer

163
00:10:27.799 --> 00:10:30.840
so we can examine how this works.

164
00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:35.719
In my repository folder, I'll create a new file called personalfile.txt

165
00:10:35.719 --> 00:10:39.440
that has a line of text in it.

166
00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.280
Because this is a new file, GitHub Desktop will be aware of it

167
00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:45.760
and prompt me to commit it to the repository.

168
00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.400
When I return to GitHub Desktop,

169
00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:50.760
the file is in fact represented as a changed file

170
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.719
ready to be committed to my local repository.

171
00:10:53.719 --> 00:10:55.400
But I don't want GitHub to notice this file

172
00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.280
so I'll ask the tool to ignore it.

173
00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.960
When I right-click on the file in GitHub Desktop,

174
00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.320
the menu allows me to add the file to gitignore.

175
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.400
Even though I don't have a gitignore file yet,

176
00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.320
GitHub Desktop will create one for me.

177
00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.919
If I already had a gitignore file,

178
00:11:10.919 --> 00:11:14.080
GitHub Desktop would add personalfile.txt

179
00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:17.159
to the list of files it should ignore.

180
00:11:17.159 --> 00:11:20.679
I'll select ignore file, add to .gitignore,

181
00:11:20.679 --> 00:11:23.520
so GitHub will ignore the file.

182
00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.840
When I choose to ignore personalfile.txt,

183
00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.760
it becomes hidden from GitHub Desktop

184
00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:32.119
and the tool no longer notices any changes I make to the file.

185
00:11:32.119 --> 00:11:34.760
It also created the gitignore file for me.

186
00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.440
I can then commit gitignore to my repository

187
00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.119
and sync it with github.com so it's safe in both places.

188
00:11:45.239 --> 00:11:48.320
In this video, you learned how to set up a GitHub repository.

189
00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.960
Using GitHub with Desktop tools,

190
00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.799
developers can securely store their source code,

191
00:11:52.799 --> 00:11:54.559
share it with others, and track changes

192
00:11:54.559 --> 00:11:56.000
as they work on their code.
