WEBVTT

1
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.980
Creating exceptional
user interactions with

2
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.820
your web application requires

3
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.360
the coordination of many parts,

4
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.280
including people in systems.

5
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.960
Keeping all these parts moving

6
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.160
through the production process

7
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.560
smoothly requires efficient

8
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.720
management tools and processes.

9
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.560
In this video, you'll learn

10
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.175
methods for effective
workflow management.

11
00:00:26.175 --> 00:00:29.490
Let's start with a definition
of workflow management.

12
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.630
Workflow management
is the process

13
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.590
of coordinating tasks, tools,

14
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.110
and team members to ensure

15
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.950
efficient and effective
project completion.

16
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.650
One of the benefits of
workflow management is that it

17
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.490
facilitates the coordination
automation of work.

18
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.990
It also enables work to
be shared among the team.

19
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.270
Workflow management
also provides

20
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.040
protection against
issues becoming serious.

21
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.970
Let's now explore one of the
most critical components of

22
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.290
workflow management,
Version Control Systems.

23
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.070
These systems act as

24
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.990
the backbone of your
development process,

25
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.070
ensuring that all team
members are in sync,

26
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.455
and that your project remains
stable as it evolves.

27
00:01:07.455 --> 00:01:11.350
Version control systems
or VCSs, like GitHub,

28
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.810
help development teams store

29
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.890
versions of changes
in their code,

30
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.750
track history, and share

31
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.685
their code with
other team members.

32
00:01:18.685 --> 00:01:20.910
A version control
system serves as

33
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.810
a storage depot or
repository for all the code,

34
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.370
images, videos, and other assets

35
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.365
a front end team produces.

36
00:01:28.365 --> 00:01:31.520
It also allows the team
to track code changes and

37
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.120
enables the team to revert to

38
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.960
previous versions of the
code if it's needed.

39
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.000
Imagine a team of front-end

40
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.580
developers working
on a new website.

41
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.880
Each developer is assigned
different parts of the site.

42
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.800
One is handling the home page,

43
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.560
another the contact page,

44
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.205
and another the navigation menu.

45
00:01:50.205 --> 00:01:52.820
Using GitHub, they all can work

46
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.520
simultaneously on their
respective parts.

47
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.760
When the navigation
menu developer

48
00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.600
accidentally introduces a bug,

49
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.420
they can use GitHub to revert to

50
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.080
a previous version without
affecting the other's work.

51
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.180
Meanwhile, they can check on

52
00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.620
each other's changes and
collaborate seamlessly,

53
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.780
ensuring the entire
project stays in sync.

54
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.290
Version control systems are

55
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.210
primarily used to
manage a code base,

56
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.270
but modern VCSs can also help

57
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.510
teams automate parts of
the development process.

58
00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.010
Teams need to be able
to integrate and

59
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.070
deploy their code when it
reaches certain milestones.

60
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.990
While version control systems
help you manage all of

61
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.510
the assets involved in a project

62
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.350
and can help you manage changes,

63
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.330
it's source control
integration that

64
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.030
manages a much more specific
subset of your work,

65
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.830
which is the source code itself.

66
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.760
Source control integration is

67
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.560
the process of
combining code changes

68
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.160
from multiple developers into

69
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.120
a shared project repository,

70
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.640
ensuring that these changes
work together correctly.

71
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.800
Once code from all developers
is integrated, debugged,

72
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.840
and complete, it's ready
to be deployed for users.

73
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.860
Source control systems
can deploy directly to

74
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.460
the systems that deliver
the application to users.

75
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.970
Developers can use
source control tools to

76
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.810
manually integrate and
deploy source code.

77
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.110
However, modern software systems

78
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.110
can automate these processes and

79
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.250
continuously integrate
and deploy code

80
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.370
as it is put into the
version control system.

81
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.770
These systems or pipelines are

82
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.430
called continuous
integration and

83
00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.990
continuous deployment
pipelines or CICD pipelines.

84
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.730
CICD pipelines automate
the testing, integration,

85
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.070
and deployment of code,

86
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.910
ensuring that new
changes are quickly

87
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.555
and reliably delivered to users.

88
00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:44.980
These tools and systems create

89
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.800
an environment that
can move quickly,

90
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.460
deliver value to users,

91
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.245
and respond rapidly to a
changing digital environment.

92
00:03:52.245 --> 00:03:54.400
Developers use the term

93
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.460
agile to describe this
development method.

94
00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.700
Agile methodology is a
process of developing

95
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.680
software that includes an
iterative development approach,

96
00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.940
continuous feedback, and
flexible responses to change.

97
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.820
This approach enhances
collaboration

98
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.625
and delivers value
incrementally.

99
00:04:13.625 --> 00:04:16.950
The agile method and the
tools that enable it were

100
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.650
developed to accommodate
today's continuously connected,

101
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.970
rapidly moving
digital environment.

102
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.950
The agile method has many
characteristics that make it

103
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.550
an ideal approach for
developing modern software.

104
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.730
One characteristic of agile
is iterative development.

105
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.190
In this approach,
agile teams develop

106
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.690
software and sprints typically
over a two week period.

107
00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.530
They work on small,
manageable pieces and

108
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.010
deliver functional increments
at the end of each sprint.

109
00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.050
This allows for regular
assessment and allows

110
00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.550
the team to rapidly adjust
the project's direction.

111
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.010
Agile also emphasizes
continuous feedback

112
00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.570
from stakeholders and end users.

113
00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.250
This feedback loop helps the
developers to ensure that

114
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.910
the product meets
the user's needs

115
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.730
and allows for quick
course corrections.

116
00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.710
Agile teams can be
flexible and embrace

117
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.170
changes in requirements even

118
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.290
late in the development process.

119
00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.590
This flexibility ensures that

120
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:15.890
the final application is

121
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.640
continuously relevant
and valuable.

122
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.110
The agile method offers
enhanced collaboration

123
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.230
as it encourages
close collaboration

124
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.610
among all team members,
including developers,

125
00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.830
testers, product owners,
and stakeholders.

126
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.050
Agile also includes
meetings like

127
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.170
regular stand-ups,
sprint planning,

128
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.070
and retrospectives, to examine

129
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.350
past work and facilitate
collaboration.

130
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.490
Version control
systems like GitHub

131
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.910
are integral to
agile development.

132
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.890
They enable multiple team
members to share code,

133
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:50.600
track changes, and
manage versions.

134
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.390
This ensures that code
is continuously up to

135
00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.830
date and that conflicts can
be resolved efficiently.

136
00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.870
Agile teams use
continuous integration to

137
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.870
ensure that the code is
always ready to be deployed.

138
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.330
They also continuously deploy

139
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.430
code to automate the
deployment process,

140
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.330
allowing new features
and fixes to be

141
00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.460
released frequently
and reliably.

142
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.610
Agile uses self organizing
teams where teams

143
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.270
organize around the
project's needs

144
00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.650
and the skills of
the team members.

145
00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.350
Team members are empowered
to make decisions

146
00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.050
on most aspects of the
development process.

147
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.690
This autonomy
fosters innovation,

148
00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.650
accountability, and a sense

149
00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.210
of ownership among
the team members.

150
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.750
In this video, you learned

151
00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:39.670
methods for effective
workflow management,

152
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:42.410
including version control,
continuous integration,

153
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.365
and deployment of code
and agile methodologies.

154
00:06:45.365 --> 00:06:47.370
Understanding
workflow management

155
00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:48.630
will make you a more effective

156
00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:50.350
contributor as you continue

157
00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:53.260
on this journey to
becoming a developer.
