00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.230
Imagine you're tasked when
navigating a complex maze.

2
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.310
At every turn, there's
a decision to be made,

3
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:14.970
and each choice you
make could either lead

4
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.370
you closer to your
goal or further away.

5
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.990
Now think of front-end
development as that maze

6
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.970
with each project bringing
its own twists and turns.

7
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.390
Without a clear
plan, you might find

8
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.210
yourself lost in a tangle
of tasks and deadlines.

9
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.510
That's where project
planning comes in.

10
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.170
It serves as your roadmap,

11
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.750
guiding you through each
phase of the project.

12
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.430
In this video, we will
outline the phases

13
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.010
of front-end development
project planning.

14
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.070
The first phase in
project planning

15
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.490
is to define the
project requirements.

16
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.230
First, let's break down what

17
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.430
'project requirements'
really mean.

18
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.510
A project's requirements are

19
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.750
the outcomes that must
be met and the tasks

20
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.390
that must be completed to ensure

21
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.090
its success and
completion on time.

22
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.270
You define your
project's requirements

23
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.770
by asking questions like,

24
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.950
"What's this application
going to do?",

25
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.880
"Who will be using the front-end?",

26
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.910
and "What technology does
the project need?"

27
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.090
Responses to questions like

28
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.050
these define and shape the
direction of the project.

29
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.170
When you define project
requirements correctly,

30
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.570
you align the project with

31
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.170
client expectations
and user needs.

32
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.850
This helps to ensure that
the final product is both

33
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.340
functional for the user and
satisfactory to the client.

34
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.470
With our requirements clear,

35
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.390
the next phase is
translating these

36
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.050
into actionable
project objectives.

37
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.850
Project objectives
are specific results

38
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.110
that a person or a process

39
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.350
aims to achieve within

40
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.510
a time frame and with
available resources.

41
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.830
Clear project objectives provide

42
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.550
a roadmap for the project.

43
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.350
They help to focus the
project team's efforts

44
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.360
and allocate resources
effectively.

45
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.380
After defining the
project requirements

46
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.960
and setting its objectives,

47
00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.840
we can begin creating
timelines to

48
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.720
plan how we get the
project completed on time.

49
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.500
Creating timelines
involves scheduling

50
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.520
all tasks and milestones
from start to finish.

51
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.800
This way, the team
can keep track of

52
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.485
progress and stay on
top of deadlines.

53
00:02:11.485 --> 00:02:13.620
By setting up timelines,

54
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.860
everyone will be clear on when

55
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.435
the front-end work
needs to be finished.

56
00:02:17.435 --> 00:02:20.460
Timelines drive the
completion of tasks and

57
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.600
establish when
specific deliverables

58
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.920
are expected to be completed.

59
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.660
We've gone through the
first three phases-

60
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.000
defining requirements,

61
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.680
setting objectives, and
creating timelines.

62
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.120
Now, we can figure out
the project resources

63
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.430
we will need in the last phase.

64
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.370
What do we mean by
"project resources"?

65
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.740
Project resources are
the assets, materials,

66
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.240
and human capital needed to

67
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.580
complete a project successfully.

68
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.120
Identifying the
resources a project

69
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.480
will need includes
determining what tools,

70
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.440
technologies, and team members

71
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.760
are required to
complete the project.

72
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.100
As an organization
evaluates resource needs,

73
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.340
it may need to select the
appropriate framework

74
00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.880
for building the website,

75
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.390
determine the
number of front-end

76
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.760
developers it will need,

77
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.260
and ensure that budgets for

78
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.120
infrastructure and marketing
have been allocated.

79
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.820
Proper resource
allocation can ensure

80
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.080
the project has everything
it needs to succeed,

81
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.500
reducing the risk of
resource shortages

82
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.700
, and budget overruns.

83
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.320
In this video, you learned about

84
00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.820
the four phases of
front-end project planning.

85
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.500
By following these phases,

86
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.960
you can ensure a smooth and
successful project execution.

87
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.200
Thorough project
planning is essential

88
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.380
for aligning with
client expectations,

89
00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.520
meeting user needs, and
achieving project objectives.
