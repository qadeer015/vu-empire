1
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.200
Suppose a teammate
and I are building

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.580
a new website as my first
development project.

3
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.160
I've set up my repository on

4
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.080
GitHub and I've
added my first file,

5
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.780
but now I'm ready to work
with my teammate on the site.

6
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.760
In this video, you'll learn
how to collaborate on GitHub.

7
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.900
Let's get started. I've already

8
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.260
logged into my GitHub account,

9
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.160
and I'm on the code tab of
the project repository.

10
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.960
This tab shows me
all the code in

11
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.010
my repository and gives me
options for managing it.

12
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.620
To add my teammate as a
collaborator on my repository,

13
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:34.495
I'll select the settings tab.

14
00:00:34.495 --> 00:00:36.140
Adding a collaborator on

15
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.820
GitHub allows them
to contribute to

16
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.900
the project by pushing
changes, managing branches,

17
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.580
reviewing code,
and participating

18
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.040
in project discussions,

19
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.100
so I'll be sure to
only add teammates I

20
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.450
know and want working
on the repository.

21
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.660
Next, I'll select collaborators
from the side menu.

22
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.400
To begin adding my teammate,

23
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.955
I'll select add people,

24
00:00:54.955 --> 00:00:56.620
a screen will pop up to add

25
00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.940
a collaborator to
the website project.

26
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.940
Here I'll type in
the user name of

27
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.450
my teammate, which
is discipula0619.

28
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.600
When the correct
user name appears,

29
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.335
I'll select it from the list.

30
00:01:07.335 --> 00:01:09.870
Finally, I'll select the add

31
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.750
discipula0619 to the
repository button,

32
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.480
this will send an invitation to

33
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.370
my teammate to collaborate
on the repository.

34
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.320
Once I invite my teammate
to the repository,

35
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.180
they need to accept
the invitation.

36
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.280
Until they accept,
they will show as

37
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.420
pending in my
collaborator's dashboard.

38
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.100
Once they accept, their status

39
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.765
will change to collaborator.

40
00:01:29.765 --> 00:01:31.480
Now that I've added my teammate,

41
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.660
I can start creating
and tracking issues.

42
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.975
I select the issues tab
to set up my first issue.

43
00:01:36.975 --> 00:01:39.820
Issues in GitHub are a
tool for tracking bugs,

44
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.600
suggesting features and
managing project tasks.

45
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.780
The website my
teammate and I are

46
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.380
creating needs the
homepage to be structured.

47
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.040
I create an issue for this by

48
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.235
selecting the new issue button.

49
00:01:51.235 --> 00:01:53.880
On the next screen,
I'll add a title,

50
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.600
the title should be
descriptive but concise.

51
00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.500
I'll name the issue, feature
structure homepage layout.

52
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.300
Next, I'll add a description of

53
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.160
the task and any requirements.

54
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.260
In the description
box for this issue,

55
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.895
I'll add task, create the
basic layout for the homepage.

56
00:02:09.895 --> 00:02:13.300
Details, header section
with navigation menu,

57
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.860
section with background
image and headline,

58
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.780
content section,
and footer section.

59
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.180
Requirements, ensure
the layout is

60
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.900
responsive for mobile
and desktop views.

61
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.800
I can also add images or files
such as design documents.

62
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.480
I want to add a design document

63
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.180
that shows the
design of the page,

64
00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.720
so I select paste,

65
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.040
drop, or click to add files.

66
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.120
I select the correct
file and select open.

67
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.920
After I've added the file,

68
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.020
I need to add details
of the issue.

69
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.840
I select assignees and
choose from the list.

70
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.620
I'm able to choose
anyone that is

71
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.920
a collaborator in my repository.

72
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.000
Next, I select labels.

73
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.190
Since this is a new feature,
I select enhancement.

74
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.620
Since I do not have any
repository assigned

75
00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.320
any projects or milestones,
I'll skip those for now.

76
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.920
To finalize the issue,

77
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.860
I will then select,
submit new issue.

78
00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.060
Notice the issue
appears on a new page.

79
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.075
It has a status of open,

80
00:03:09.075 --> 00:03:11.240
it includes the
information that I added,

81
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.220
as well as an area for comments.

82
00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.120
It also includes a section
called development that

83
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.800
allows me or a collaborator

84
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.140
to create a branch
for this issue.

85
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.460
Now, suppose my
teammate has done

86
00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.000
some development
work on the issue,

87
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.460
they committed their code and

88
00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.680
are ready to create
a pull request.

89
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.200
A pull request in
GitHub is a proposal

90
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.820
to merge changes from
one branch into another,

91
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.240
allowing for code review

92
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.735
and discussion
before integration.

93
00:03:36.735 --> 00:03:39.350
I'm going to switch
over to my teammates

94
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.340
account and create
a pull request.

95
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.090
To do so, I go to the pull
request tab then I can

96
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.950
select compare and
pull requests that are

97
00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.170
featured for the new
branch that was created.

98
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.130
In a pull request, the base is

99
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.250
the branch where you want
to merge your changes,

100
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.010
and the compare is
the branch that

101
00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.710
contains the changes you
want to merge into the base.

102
00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.490
I double check that the
base branch is main,

103
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.270
and the compare
branch is the branch

104
00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.760
my teammate was working
on, descipula branch.

105
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.430
Then I add a clear
descriptive title like

106
00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.890
feature add header section
with navigation menu.

107
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.310
Next, I'll add a description,

108
00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.520
the description should
include a summary,

109
00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.040
details, and any testing
criteria for a pull request.

110
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.900
For this pull request,
I'll add summary,

111
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.980
this pull request
adds a header section

112
00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.340
with a navigation menu
to the home page.

113
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.280
Details create a fixed
header with the sites logo,

114
00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.640
add a responsive navigation
menu with links to home,

115
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.035
about, services, and
contact sections.

116
00:04:38.035 --> 00:04:40.770
Testing, ensure the header

117
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.090
is visible and fixed at
the top of the page.

118
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.150
Verify that the navigation link

119
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.410
scroll to the appropriate
sections on the page,

120
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.070
check the responsiveness of

121
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.270
the header on different
screen sizes.

122
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.690
Then I'll double check
who the reviewer is.

123
00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.560
I verify that it is my
account, learner 0615.

124
00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.850
I select request to
request the review.

125
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.830
Code reviews are important
for maintaining code quality,

126
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.540
so it's important to have
someone review your code.

127
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.615
Finally, I select create

128
00:05:08.615 --> 00:05:11.230
pull request to
create the request.

129
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.170
Now, I'll switch back
to my GitHub account

130
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.230
to review the code and
merge the changes.

131
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.050
I've received a
notification that

132
00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.870
my teammate has requested a
review of their pull request.

133
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.905
I select, add your review
to begin my code review.

134
00:05:23.905 --> 00:05:26.610
I read through the new
code and do a review.

135
00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.630
I'm checking for code
correctness, readability,

136
00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.570
adherence to coding standards,

137
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.290
potential impact, and

138
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.650
the impact on existing
functionality.

139
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.490
I noticed that the
code is accurate,

140
00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.050
but my teammate did not add

141
00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.460
a shop navigation item to
the top level navigation.

142
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.730
I select review changes
to leave feedback.

143
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.890
I will also add a
detailed comment

144
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.810
about the missing
navigation item.

145
00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.895
Since the rest of the code is
correct, I select approve.

146
00:05:52.895 --> 00:05:55.310
This will submit the
feedback to my teammate,

147
00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:56.710
but also approve merging

148
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.090
the existing changes
to the main branch.

149
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:00.890
Merging is the process of

150
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.730
combining changes from
one branch into another,

151
00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.930
typically, integrating new
code into the main branch.

152
00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.485
Then I select the
submit review button

153
00:06:09.485 --> 00:06:11.780
this takes me back
to the pull request.

154
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.690
Even though I
approve the changes,

155
00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.280
it did not automatically
merge the changes.

156
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.710
To merge the changes,
I select merge,

157
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.830
pull request, and then
select, confirm merge.

158
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.510
There's now a button
to delete branch,

159
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.230
but I won't do that.

160
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.550
Today, you learned
how to collaborate

161
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.190
on a GitHub project from

162
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.270
adding collaborators
and managing issues

163
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:37.490
to creating pull requests,

164
00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:39.450
and conducting code reviews.

165
00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:42.170
These tools and processes
are essential for

166
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.230
effective teamwork
and maintaining

167
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:47.310
code quality in any
development project.
