00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.830
Welcome to the course.
In this video,

2
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:11.710
we will discuss how you
can make the most of

3
00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.830
each part of the course to
set yourself up for success.

4
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.650
Whether you watch the videos,

5
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.770
complete activities, or
work through hands-on labs.

6
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.170
Each element has been
designed to help you master

7
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.570
the skills you need to become

8
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.830
a confident and
capable developer.

9
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.650
The first step in every
lesson is the videos.

10
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.770
You'll be introduced
to new concepts,

11
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.910
definitions, and key ideas.

12
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.450
Watch these carefully and

13
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.570
take notes on the
important points.

14
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.890
The videos provide the
foundational knowledge

15
00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.250
you'll need to build
on, so don't skip them.

16
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.930
They'll give you the context to

17
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.345
understand everything
that comes next.

18
00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:48.690
After each video,
complete the readings.

19
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.430
These readings
reinforce the key ideas

20
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.940
you've just learned and
can serve as job aids.

21
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.960
I recommend printing
out the readings,

22
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.210
or saving them for
quick reference.

23
00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.570
They'll be extremely helpful
when completing activities,

24
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.850
working on projects,

25
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.510
or just needing a refresher.

26
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.510
They're not just supplementary.

27
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.790
They help you apply what you've

28
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.905
learned to real world tasks.

29
00:01:09.905 --> 00:01:11.960
Throughout the
course, you'll find

30
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.100
small but impactful activities.

31
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.380
These quick exercises
allow you to check

32
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.850
your understanding of key ideas;

33
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.630
don't rush through them.

34
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.500
Take the time to work through

35
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.420
these activities thoughtfully.

36
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.700
After each, compare answers with

37
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.000
the answer key to check

38
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.260
how well you understand
the material.

39
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.150
This is your chance to
practice without pressure.

40
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.580
At the end of each lesson,

41
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.600
you'll encounter
practice quizzes.

42
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.480
These quizzes are a great
way to ensure you fully

43
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.700
grasp the concepts from the
videos and the readings.

44
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.720
Use these as a checkpoint to

45
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.220
assess how well you
retain the information.

46
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.300
If you find yourself struggling,

47
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.940
review the videos
and readings again.

48
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.180
The goal is to build
confidence and

49
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.380
solidify your understanding
before moving forward.

50
00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.680
When you need to
see the material in

51
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.370
action, screencasts guide you.

52
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.520
These videos show
you exactly how to

53
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.240
work through certain
tasks step by step.

54
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.020
If you ever feel stuck or

55
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.820
unsure about applying a concept,

56
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.795
watch the screencasts
and follow along.

57
00:02:13.795 --> 00:02:16.300
This hands-on guidance
is invaluable

58
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.430
for understanding how the
code works in real-time,

59
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.630
and applying what
you've learned.

60
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.630
At the end of each module,

61
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.660
there will be graded quizzes.

62
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.450
These are an important part
of your success as they

63
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.310
allow you to demonstrate
mastery of the material.

64
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.850
These quizzes build on
the practice quizzes,

65
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.570
and they are a great way
to ensure you're ready

66
00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.130
to move on to more
advanced concepts.

67
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.030
Treat these quizzes
as milestones.

68
00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.690
Passing them means you're fully

69
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.950
prepared for the next challenge.

70
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.270
The guided labs are where you'll

71
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.810
take the concepts
from the lessons,

72
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.210
and apply them in a controlled
hands-on environment.

73
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.650
These labs will take you
step by step through tasks,

74
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.270
including helpful
feedback and hints.

75
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.030
The more effort you put into

76
00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.010
the labs, the more
you'll get out of them.

77
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.830
It's all about
learning by doing,

78
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.230
so take your time and ensure you

79
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.930
understand each step
before moving on.

80
00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.610
After you've completed
the guided labs,

81
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.130
it's time to test
your skills with

82
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.770
independent projects
or You Try It!.

83
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.090
This is where you'll
apply everything you've

84
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.745
learned without
step-by-step instructions.

85
00:03:18.745 --> 00:03:20.650
These projects are a great way

86
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:21.990
to gauge how far you've come,

87
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.300
and to put your
knowledge to the test.

88
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.310
Don't worry if you
feel challenged,

89
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.990
that's part of the
learning process.

90
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.670
By completing these projects,

91
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.850
you'll reinforce your skills
and build confidence.

92
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.870
Finally, at the
end of the course,

93
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.170
you'll complete a
culminating hands-on project

94
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.850
that you can use as a
portfolio artifact.

95
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.650
This project will showcase

96
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.230
the skills you've gained
throughout the course,

97
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.530
and give you
something tangible to

98
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.835
present to potential employers.

99
00:03:46.835 --> 00:03:49.100
As you progress to the program,

100
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.840
these portfolio
pieces will become

101
00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.420
stronger representations of
your hands-on experience,

102
00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.200
and understanding
of key concepts.

103
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.580
Success in this course comes

104
00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.600
down to using all
the tools available.

105
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.460
Watch the videos carefully,

106
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.240
engage with the readings,

107
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.075
complete the activities
and quizzes thoughtfully,

108
00:04:07.075 --> 00:04:08.540
and take full advantage of

109
00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.620
the screencasts,
labs, and projects.

110
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.260
Each element of this
course is designed to

111
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.955
help you master the
material step by step.

112
00:04:16.955 --> 00:04:19.480
By the end you'll have a
solid understanding of

113
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.620
the concepts and real projects
to prove your skills.

114
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.400
Remember to persist.
Take your time,

115
00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.820
and you'll be ready for a

116
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.280
successful career
in development.
