2
00:00:07.627 --> 00:00:10.431
In today's rapidly
evolving tech landscape,

3
00:00:10.431 --> 00:00:15.337
artificial intelligence plays a key role
in making development more efficient and

4
00:00:15.337 --> 00:00:18.855
intelligent, that's where
Microsoft Copilot comes in.

5
00:00:18.855 --> 00:00:23.497
Microsoft Copilot is a powerful, AI-driven
tool that can assist developers in

6
00:00:23.497 --> 00:00:26.920
writing, optimizing, and debugging code.

7
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.174
In this course, you'll leverage
Copilot as a thought partner and

8
00:00:30.174 --> 00:00:34.414
a code generating assistant, helping you
solve problems, generate code snippets,

9
00:00:34.414 --> 00:00:36.440
and enhance your projects.

10
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.903
The goal is to provide you with hands
on experience using a tool that real

11
00:00:39.903 --> 00:00:43.280
world developers use to
improve their workflow.

12
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.798
In the last module of this course,
you'll engage in videos, screencasts,

13
00:00:47.798 --> 00:00:52.410
guided labs, and independent
projects that integrate Copilot.

14
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.799
These labs will take you through how to
use specific prompts to generate code,

15
00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:00.130
optimize solutions, and solve problems.

16
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.656
You`ll be shown step by step how to
leverage Copilot's capabilities to

17
00:01:03.656 --> 00:01:06.770
strategically approach the final project.

18
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.090
During the guided labs, you'll get hands
on experience working with Copilot.

19
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.601
These labs are structured to show you
how to craft effective prompts and

20
00:01:14.601 --> 00:01:18.020
work with Copilot's code
generation features.

21
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.340
You'll use it to assist in writing code,
refining your solutions, and debugging.

22
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.877
This practice will prepare you for

23
00:01:24.877 --> 00:01:27.320
the independent work you'll
do in the final project.

24
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.198
After the videos,
screencasts, or guided labs,

25
00:01:31.198 --> 00:01:34.640
you'll move on to independent
activities where you'll take control.

26
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.060
Here, you'll use Copilot to assist
with various aspects of the project.

27
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.766
You'll be making strategic decisions, but
Copilot will support you by generating

28
00:01:44.766 --> 00:01:49.390
code, suggesting optimizations and
helping you troubleshoot.

29
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.654
This prepares you to work more
independently while still

30
00:01:52.654 --> 00:01:54.561
having the power of AI to assist.

31
00:01:54.561 --> 00:01:58.719
The final project will combine
everything you've learned in the course,

32
00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:03.190
and you'll have Copilot as a key
tool in your development toolkit.

33
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.432
You'll use Copilot to
help you generate and

34
00:02:05.432 --> 00:02:08.650
refine code as you combine
the concepts from earlier lessons.

35
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.995
The project is a portfolio ready artifact
showcasing your coding skills and

36
00:02:13.995 --> 00:02:17.785
your ability to leverage AI in
modern development workflow flows.

37
00:02:17.785 --> 00:02:21.760
To succeed in the final module,
actively engage with the guided labs and

38
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.010
practice using
Microsoft Copilot effectively.

39
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.488
The videos and
prompts will take you through Copilot and

40
00:02:27.488 --> 00:02:30.770
equip you to apply it strategically and
independently.

41
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.892
By the end of the course, you'll be fully
prepared to complete the final project and

42
00:02:34.892 --> 00:02:38.794
demonstrate your skills using traditional
coding and AI assisted workflows.

43
00:02:38.794 --> 00:02:39.294
