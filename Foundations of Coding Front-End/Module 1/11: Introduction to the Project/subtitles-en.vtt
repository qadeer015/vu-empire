00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.840
Every successful coding project starts with a solid plan.

2
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.720
By carefully organizing and outlining your project, you'll ensure all the parts come

3
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.260
together smoothly.

4
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.720
This process may seem like extra work, but it lays the foundation for success.

5
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.560
With this plan in place, a developer can then write, debug, and optimize code to build dynamic,

6
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.920
responsive applications.

7
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.080
In this video, we will explain the end-of-course project.

8
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.040
This project simulates real-world software development.

9
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.440
You'll start by designing and planning an application, then building the basics, debugging

10
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.480
and refining your code as it grows more complex.

11
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.100
By the end, you'll integrate everything into a polished, final product.

12
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.120
The goal is to experience the full coding process, writing, fixing, and improving your

13
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.120
code.

14
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.280
Before writing any code, you'll plan and design an application.

15
00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.640
This will involve defining project requirements and objectives and creating a design outline.

16
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.819
With a plan in place, you'll then write the core features of your application.

17
00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:09.680
This step establishes basic functionality that will be expanded later.

18
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.320
Once the core features are in place, errors will naturally appear.

19
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.600
You should then focus on debugging, identifying issues, and ensuring everything works correctly.

20
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.840
Refining your code at this stage is critical for smooth performance.

21
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.760
As your system grows, debugging manually becomes time-consuming.

22
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.400
Here we'll use Microsoft Copilot to help find and fix errors quickly.

23
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.900
Copilot offers AI suggestions that streamline the debugging process and improve system performance.

24
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.140
By the end of the project, the final product will be a polished system ready for use.

25
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.640
In this project, you will go from planning to building, debugging, and refining your

26
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.240
code.

27
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.840
Following a structured process, you will create a functional system that mirrors the real

28
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.160
world development cycle.

29
00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.440
This experience will teach you the value of careful planning, problem solving, and using

30
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.240
tools like AI to optimize your work.
