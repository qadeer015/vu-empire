Version Control Systems
Introduction
Git helps developers track changes, revert to previous versions, and collaborate without conflicts. It is a distributed system, meaning each developer has a complete history of the project's versions locally.

Key Git Commands
Clone copies a repository to your local machine (git clone [repository URL]), allowing offline development.

Branch creates a new branch to work on a feature or fix independently (git branch [branch name]), keeping the main codebase stable.

Commit records a snapshot of changes with a message (git commit -m "message"), documenting progress.

Push uploads local changes to a remote repository (git push [remote] [branch]) and shares updates with the team.

Pull fetches and merges changes from the remote repository to the local one (git pull [remote] [branch]), ensuring all developers are up-to-date.

Using GitHub for Collaboration
Creating a repository on GitHub stores project files and tracks their history. Repositories can be set as public or private. To maintain stability, use branches to develop different features or fixes independently and merge them into the main branch after review. Submit pull requests to propose changes, allowing team members to review and discuss updates before merging. Conduct code reviews to catch errors, maintain standards, and ensure functionality before integrating new code.

Conclusion
Understanding Git commands and GitHub workflows helps developers manage code efficiently, collaborate effectively, and maintain high-quality software.
