00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.560
When working on a
big coding project,

2
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.600
each person handles
different parts.

3
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.140
But if there isn't a clear plan,

4
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.980
problems can happen quickly.

5
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.515
Code can clash,

6
00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:17.680
people might do the same work,

7
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.160
and progress can slow
down or even stop.

8
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.540
This is why having a strong
project plan is so important.

9
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.480
In this video, we'll identify

10
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.400
key project planning
considerations

11
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.045
for version control
and collaboration.

12
00:00:30.045 --> 00:00:32.210
When planning a coding project,

13
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.650
it's easy to focus on
features and deadlines,

14
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.430
but it's also important to plan

15
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.770
for collaboration
and version control.

16
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.510
Without a solid plan for

17
00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.090
collaboration and
version control,

18
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.030
your project could experience
problems like delays,

19
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.830
merge conflicts, or even
complete code failures.

20
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.030
By planning for
how your team will

21
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.830
collaborate and
manage code changes,

22
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.210
you can avoid these
kinds of problems.

23
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.090
Let's start by exploring

24
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.515
the considerations
for collaboration.

25
00:00:59.515 --> 00:01:02.330
Coding is rarely
a solo activity.

26
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:03.950
Keens need to work together

27
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.510
efficiently to keep
things moving and

28
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.150
ensure that everyone's
contributions

29
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.360
fit together seamlessly.

30
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.910
A couple of key aspects to focus

31
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.410
on our code reviews
and documentation.

32
00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.050
These ensure the
quality and clarity of

33
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.250
your project as your team
scales or new members join.

34
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.370
One of the most
important aspects

35
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.450
of collaboration
is code reviews.

36
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.250
They're essential
for maintaining

37
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.990
quality across the team.

38
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.090
Let's explore this further.

39
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.710
Code reviews are crucial part

40
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.410
of maintaining code quality.

41
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.150
Code reviews are evaluations

42
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.610
of code by other developers to

43
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.170
ensure it meets
quality standards

44
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.150
and adheres to best practices.

45
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.990
For example, during your review,

46
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.190
a teammate might catch
a small bug that could

47
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.120
later cause major issues
if left unchecked.

48
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.090
When planning for how to
collaborate using code reviews,

49
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.490
you should decide if every
pull request will require

50
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.710
one or more reviews before being

51
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.210
merged and how reviewers
will provide feedback.

52
00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.010
These are essential
decisions to answer clearly,

53
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.970
so there's no confusion
down the road.

54
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.030
Now, let's move on
to documentation,

55
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.950
another key aspect of
smooth collaboration.

56
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.670
Documentation refers to
written material that

57
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.030
explains the
functionality, usage,

58
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.310
and maintenance of software
to help developers and

59
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.610
users understand and interact
with the code effectively.

60
00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.290
Documentation can include how
to set up the environment,

61
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.530
explanations for key features,

62
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.750
and instructions on how to
contribute to the project.

63
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.230
It's also important
to plan for how

64
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.310
the team will create and
maintain documentation.

65
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.890
This includes who will
be responsible for

66
00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.050
documentation creation and where

67
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.170
documentation will be stored.

68
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.890
GitHub makes documentation
easier because it

69
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.550
allows teams to keep all
their files in one place,

70
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.635
including any necessary
documentation.

71
00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:51.800
In GitHub, developers will
create a README file,

72
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.260
which is the first
thing anyone is

73
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.860
presented with when they
open your repository.

74
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.020
It's the perfect
place to outline what

75
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.520
your project does and
how to get started.

76
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.740
Now that we've covered
collaboration,

77
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.555
let's transition to the
technical side: version control.

78
00:03:06.555 --> 00:03:09.680
Specifically, we'll explore
branching strategies,

79
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.845
commit frequency, and
tagging and releases.

80
00:03:12.845 --> 00:03:15.770
Planning a branching
strategy is all about

81
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.910
deciding how your team
will organize code.

82
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.290
Typically, you will
have a main branch with

83
00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.410
a stable code and feature
branches for new development.

84
00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.430
This structure keeps work
organized and prevents

85
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.790
unfinished code from being
added to the main code base.

86
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.290
When planning a
branching strategy,

87
00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.170
the team will determine what
branches they will use,

88
00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.410
whether there will be a
branch for every feature,

89
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.790
bug fix or release,

90
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.310
and how the team will handle

91
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.525
merging back into
the main branch.

92
00:03:43.525 --> 00:03:45.660
Establishing these rules upfront

93
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.350
keeps your workflow smooth.

94
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.330
Similarly, how often
developers commit changes,

95
00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:51.650
known as commit frequency,

96
00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.550
keeps the project organized.

97
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.250
Small frequent commits
help track progress

98
00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.310
and makes it easier to debug
if something goes wrong.

99
00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.335
Encourage your team
to commit often.

100
00:04:02.335 --> 00:04:04.400
When planning decide whether

101
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.220
daily commits are
expected or whether

102
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.800
team members should commit after

103
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.125
completing specific tasks,

104
00:04:10.125 --> 00:04:12.000
this helps keep everyone

105
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.780
aligned and reduces
the risk of conflicts.

106
00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.620
Lastly, let's discuss
tagging and releases,

107
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.200
which helps you mark key points

108
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.945
in your project's history.

109
00:04:20.945 --> 00:04:23.490
Tags in Git mark specific points

110
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:24.750
in your project's history like

111
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.800
version1.o so you can

112
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.235
easily reference or roll
back to a specific state.

113
00:04:30.235 --> 00:04:32.990
When planning for
tagging and releases,

114
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.410
think about when and how often

115
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.510
you'll tag versions
of your project.

116
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.815
Will you tag every sprint
or a major milestone?

117
00:04:39.815 --> 00:04:42.010
and how will you name your tags?

118
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.870
Clear tagging conventions make

119
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.695
version control much easier.

120
00:04:45.695 --> 00:04:47.630
GitHub has features
that can help

121
00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.250
you plan your
branching strategy,

122
00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.310
set up guidelines
for code reviews,

123
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.190
encourage frequent
commits, and use

124
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.590
tagging to organize
your project versions.

125
00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.310
Planning for collaboration
and version control is

126
00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.270
key to keeping your project
organized and efficient.

127
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.480
Code reviews, documentation,
branching strategies,

128
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.040
commit frequency, and tagging

129
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.600
will help you and your
team work better together.

130
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.640
By planning early, you'll avoid

131
00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.900
problems and keep your
project running smoothly.
