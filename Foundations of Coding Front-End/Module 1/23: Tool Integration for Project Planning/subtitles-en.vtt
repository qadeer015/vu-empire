2
00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:12.838
Today, we use many technologies to help us
get things done, both at home and at work.

3
00:00:12.838 --> 00:00:14.169
Many of us have devices and

4
00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:18.283
applications that remind us to be more
active if we've been sitting too long, or

5
00:00:18.283 --> 00:00:23.070
help us keep track of shopping lists so
we don't forget to get the things we need.

6
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.668
We've integrated these tools into our
lives to keep us healthy and on track

7
00:00:27.668 --> 00:00:30.084
to complete the things we need to get done.

8
00:00:30.084 --> 00:00:34.575
Just as these tools help manage our
personal lives there are tools to help you

9
00:00:34.575 --> 00:00:37.070
manage projects at work.

10
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.915
In this video, you'll learn
about tools and techniques for

11
00:00:39.915 --> 00:00:42.390
project planning integration.

12
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.950
Let's start by defining what
project planning tools are.

13
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.513
Project planning tools are software
applications that assist in

14
00:00:49.513 --> 00:00:53.790
the organization, management, and
tracking of projects and tasks.

15
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.137
Project planning tools streamline and
manage tasks, enhance team collaboration,

16
00:00:59.137 --> 00:01:04.125
and improve the team's visibility into and
tracking of a project's progress.

17
00:01:04.125 --> 00:01:09.060
Using these tools effectively helps team
members complete projects on time and

18
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.630
within scope.

19
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.768
Let's explore some examples
of these tools and

20
00:01:12.768 --> 00:01:14.918
how they help guide
a project in more detail,

21
00:01:14.918 --> 00:01:21.110
starting with Jira. Jira is a powerful
project planning and issue-tracking tool.

22
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.522
Users can create tasks,
assign them to team members,

23
00:01:24.522 --> 00:01:30.110
discuss issues with the team, and
run robust reports on project status.

24
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.863
Some key advantages to using Jira come
from its ability to work with other

25
00:01:33.863 --> 00:01:35.550
applications.

26
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.066
By using Jira integrations,
teams can manage tasks directly

27
00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:44.190
from the tools they're already using
without having to switch between tools.

28
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.514
Software developers can integrate Jira
into Visual Studio Code to manage work

29
00:01:48.514 --> 00:01:51.010
items right from the tool.

30
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.859
Similarly, Jira integrates with GitHub,

31
00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:57.130
a tool teams use to
manage their source code.

32
00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.659
By using Jira and GitHub, teams can
easily link issues and make requests for

33
00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:02.310
new code.

34
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.861
Jira also integrates with
the communication tools like Slack and

35
00:02:06.861 --> 00:02:09.950
Microsoft Teams to track issues and
get notifications.

36
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.798
Jira can be an ideal tool for planning and
managing large and complex projects, but

37
00:02:15.798 --> 00:02:18.265
if your project is smaller or
less complex,

38
00:02:18.265 --> 00:02:21.970
other tools like Trello might
be better suited for it.

39
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.780
Trello is a user friendly project
management tool that uses boards, lists,

40
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.630
and cards to organize tasks.

41
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.466
Trello's card and board system makes
it easy to visualize project tasks and

42
00:02:34.466 --> 00:02:35.610
progress.

43
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.603
Similar to Jira, Trello integrates
with development environments so

44
00:02:39.603 --> 00:02:43.738
teams can manage tasks without having
to switch between multiple tools.

45
00:02:43.738 --> 00:02:47.886
Integration with tools like Slack and
GitHub enhance collaboration and

46
00:02:47.886 --> 00:02:50.130
streamline the project's workflow.

47
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.507
For example, a new GitHub issue can
automatically create a new Trello card,

48
00:02:55.507 --> 00:02:58.110
helping the team to track it visually.

49
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.770
Slack users can share Trello card updates,
comments, and notifications.

50
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.534
For teams that need more of Jira's power but
prefer Trello's usability,

51
00:03:07.534 --> 00:03:09.534
Asana could be a good fit.

52
00:03:09.534 --> 00:03:14.218
Asana is a versatile project management
tool that teams use to coordinate and

53
00:03:14.218 --> 00:03:15.452
manage their work.

54
00:03:15.452 --> 00:03:20.010
Like Jira and Trello, Asana's ability to
integrate with development environments

55
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.650
helps teams track tasks in
their existing workflow.

56
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.319
Integration with version control systems
like GitHub and communications tools like

57
00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.550
Slack ensures that updates are
synchronized, keeping everyone informed.

58
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:39.360
Users can link GitHub commits, branches,
and pull requests to Asana tasks.

59
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.848
By linking Asana with Slack, users can
share it when a task has been created and

60
00:03:43.848 --> 00:03:45.140
when it gets updated.

61
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.249
Asana can also be embedded
in Microsoft Teams so

62
00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:53.607
users can manage Asana tasks in
their team without leaving the app.

63
00:03:53.607 --> 00:03:58.177
Lets use a real-world example to further
illustrate how an organization would

64
00:03:58.177 --> 00:04:01.724
integrate a project planning
tool with other tools they use.

65
00:04:01.724 --> 00:04:03.920
Consider a company called TechFlow.

66
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.205
They start this process by choosing
a tool that fits their needs.

67
00:04:08.205 --> 00:04:12.215
TechFlow needs robust tracking
functionality and extensive integration

68
00:04:12.215 --> 00:04:16.094
options because its teams use many
different tools such as VS code,

69
00:04:16.094 --> 00:04:19.010
GitHub, Slack, and Microsoft Teams.

70
00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.170
After careful consideration,
TechFlow chooses Jira.

71
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.010
Next, they work to set
up the integrations.

72
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.900
They do this by connecting their accounts
from other tools, like GitHub, with Jira.

73
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.325
In addition, TechFlow will set up
communication between the tools to

74
00:04:35.325 --> 00:04:39.000
sync issues and updates between Jira and
its other tools.

75
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.813
With their tools integrated with Jira,
the TechFlow team defines clear workflow

76
00:04:43.813 --> 00:04:47.659
processes to ensure the integrated
tools are used effectively.

77
00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:51.859
They define how tasks will be created,
assigned, and tracked.

78
00:04:51.859 --> 00:04:56.224
As a specific example of this, the
TechFlow team will define a process where

79
00:04:56.224 --> 00:04:59.291
all GitHub issues
are automatically logged in Jira,

80
00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:03.471
assigned to the relevant team members,
and tracked until completion.

81
00:05:03.471 --> 00:05:07.943
Then, TechFlow conducts training sessions
to familiarize the team with Jira and

82
00:05:07.943 --> 00:05:10.690
its integration with tools like GitHub.

83
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.290
The training helps the team know how to
use the integrated tools effectively.

84
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.650
Finally, TechFlow implements a strategy
to regularly monitor its integrations and

85
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.370
adjust them as needed.

86
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.969
As an example, TechFlow will regularly
review its Jira-GitHub integration,

87
00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:29.950
making adjustments to optimize
task tracking and collaboration.

88
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.082
By regularly monitoring the integration,
they can adjust

89
00:05:34.082 --> 00:05:38.000
it as necessary to improve efficiency and
address any issues.

90
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.311
In this video, you learned about tools and
techniques for

91
00:05:43.311 --> 00:05:44.908
project planning integration.

92
00:05:44.908 --> 00:05:48.822
By integrating project planning
tools like Jira, Trello, and

93
00:05:48.822 --> 00:05:53.026
Asana with development environments
like VS code and Atom, and

94
00:05:53.026 --> 00:05:56.373
communication tools like
Microsoft Teams and Slack,

95
00:05:56.373 --> 00:05:59.957
project teams can significantly
enhance their task management,

96
00:05:59.957 --> 00:06:02.203
collaboration, and project tracking.

97
00:06:02.203 --> 00:06:05.730
Using these tools will also help
to ensure smoother workflows and

98
00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.471
successful project outcomes.

99
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.971
