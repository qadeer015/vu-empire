00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.199
My name is Paul Pardi and I'm your instructor for this course.

2
00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:14.159
I've been programming computers since I was in my teens.

3
00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:18.120
I love programming because it's like solving puzzles while designing and creating something

4
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.680
amazing.

5
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.920
My graduate degree is in philosophy where I learned how to become a better thinker.

6
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.280
When I program computers, I can apply many of the logic skills I learned in philosophy.

7
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.840
Computer programming not only enables you to build cool software, but I believe it can

8
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.200
help make you a better thinker.

9
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.119
I started my software development career at Microsoft when the internet was just getting

10
00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:43.040
started and I participated in the internet revolution firsthand.

11
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.700
I managed software engineering teams that worked on desktop and web-based software.

12
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.180
The internet gave software developers, particularly those working on user interface, incredible

13
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.200
new opportunities.

14
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.020
For mobile interfaces to websites, software developers are not only creating software

15
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.459
that's functional, but also works of art.

16
00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:06.400
In my career, I managed and worked with teams at both Microsoft and PayPal that focused

17
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.660
on customer-facing interfaces and learned how to make them great.

18
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.500
I also spent part of my 20 years at Microsoft in training organizations where I learned

19
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.220
how to communicate challenging ideas to new learners.

20
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.620
I also was fortunate enough to have spent 15 years teaching non-majors philosophy at

21
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.580
a university in Seattle.

22
00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.800
This reinforced my ability to teach learners difficult concepts using ideas they can relate

23
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.040
to.

24
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.519
There's nothing more satisfying than to witness a learner having an aha moment where they

25
00:01:33.519 --> 00:01:35.760
understand something new.

26
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.360
I'm really excited about this program.

27
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.360
I believe Microsoft has some of the most powerful and exciting software development tools available,

28
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.779
and I can't wait for you to learn about them.

29
00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:48.559
I'm confident you'll have many of the aha moments as you gain new skills and reinforce

30
00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:49.440
existing ones.
