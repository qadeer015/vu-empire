00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.820
Throughout this course, you'll complete several guided labs.

2
00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:13.140
These labs are meant to give you an opportunity to practice your newly learned skills in an

3
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.879
environment where you can get help and feedback as you complete coding challenges.

4
00:00:18.879 --> 00:00:23.079
This video will describe how to complete the guided labs in this course.

5
00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:27.680
We will explore a guided lab together so that you'll know what to expect when you come to

6
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.920
one later in the course.

7
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.680
First, let's check the content leading up to a guided lab.

8
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.279
This structured content ensures that you have exactly the skills you need to complete the

9
00:00:38.279 --> 00:00:39.360
task.

10
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.520
In this instance, there is a practical application video that describes in detail how this concept

11
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.200
is used in real-world situations.

12
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.479
Following this practical application video, you can review a reading that explains the

13
00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:59.799
concept in detail so you can go through this content at your own pace.

14
00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:05.199
Next, you'll find a video that works through the guided lab itself.

15
00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.480
This video won't give you all the answers to the guided lab, but it will provide an

16
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.040
overview of the upcoming questions and challenges.

17
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.559
Lastly, we come to the guided lab itself.

18
00:01:16.559 --> 00:01:22.360
The guided lab is a simulated code environment where you can experiment with code and receive

19
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.000
hints and feedback in a realistic coding situation.

20
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.040
To start, I'll click start.

21
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:40.199
In this lab, step one is an introduction to if-else statements, so I'll click begin.

22
00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:46.839
Below the simulated code environment, I can find the specific instructions for this lab.

23
00:01:46.839 --> 00:01:50.239
Declare the variable age as type int.

24
00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:56.559
Place your cursor in the line 2, type your answer, and select enter to check your work.

25
00:01:56.559 --> 00:01:59.919
Alright, I think I know this one.

26
00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:05.199
I'm going to type in int and hit enter.

27
00:02:05.199 --> 00:02:10.720
Great, I got that correct, and I got a bit of feedback about my correct answer.

28
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.479
To move on, I click continue.

29
00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:19.000
In these instructions say, prompt the user to enter their age, place your cursor in the

30
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.600
line 4, type your answer, and select enter to check your work.

31
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.960
This one is a little trickier.

32
00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:33.639
Let me try type your age.

33
00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:34.639
Got it.

34
00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:39.119
This feedback for my wrong answer points me in the right direction.

35
00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:41.919
Let's try that again.

36
00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:51.559
I'm going to erase what I had here, and then enter your age.

37
00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:54.440
Perfect.

38
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.919
I'll click continue.

39
00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:58.960
Let's try one more.

40
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:05.440
Convert the input to an integer using int.parse and store it in the age variable.

41
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.960
Place your cursor in the line 6, type your answer, and select enter to check your work.

42
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:19.279
Hmm, I'm not totally sure here, so I'm going to click on hint and get some help.

43
00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:25.800
And the hint says, use console.readline, and then an open and close parentheses, display

44
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.880
a message asking their user for their age.

45
00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.399
Great, that helps.

46
00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:46.320
I'm going to click continue and type in console.readline, and I've got it.

47
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.500
That's how you work through a guided lab.

48
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.600
Some questions will require more complex code to complete, so make sure you're using the

49
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.880
hint function when you need it and reviewing the feedback provided for your right and

50
00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.399
wrong answers.

51
00:03:59.399 --> 00:04:03.720
Have fun completing these coding challenges that put your new skills to work.
