00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.460
Imagine you're working on
a major website launch.

2
00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:11.900
The design is impeccable,

3
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.720
but it's up to you
to bring it to life,

4
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.860
ensuring that every
element looks perfect and

5
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.540
functions flawlessly
across devices.

6
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.220
As a front-end engineer,

7
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.020
you must understand the
different roles and

8
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.400
responsibilities in creating
a great user experience.

9
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.340
In this video, we will describe

10
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.120
the key tasks and
responsibilities

11
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.660
of a front-end engineer.

12
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.840
A front-end engineer is a
developer who specializes in

13
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.400
creating the user-facing parts

14
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.360
of websites and applications.

15
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.900
Creating the user-facing
parts of websites

16
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.380
and applications might
seem complicated.

17
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.040
But as a front-end engineer,

18
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.740
you'll spend your days on
four important tasks: coding,

19
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.240
testing, debugging, and
collaborating with team members.

20
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.665
To fully understand the impact
of front-end engineering,

21
00:00:55.665 --> 00:00:57.180
let's delve into the day-to-day

22
00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.610
tasks that make it all possible.

23
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.450
As a front-end engineer,

24
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.410
you'll spend much
of your day coding.

25
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.770
Coding means implementing
the designs and

26
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.210
functionalities of a
website or application,

27
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.270
using languages such as
Hypertext Markup Language,

28
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.320
or HTML, to structure the
content of a web page.

29
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.475
Cascading Style Sheets,

30
00:01:17.475 --> 00:01:19.410
also known as CSS,

31
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:20.950
to style that content,

32
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.930
making it visually appealing,

33
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.770
and JavaScript to add
interactive elements,

34
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.710
like form validation or
dynamic content loading.

35
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.230
You'll also use frameworks and

36
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.220
libraries like React, Angular,

37
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.170
or Vue.js to speed up

38
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.330
the process and utilize
reusable components.

39
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.610
Understanding these
tools is key to

40
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.530
crafting seamless
user experiences.

41
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.930
Next, you'll
dedicate significant

42
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.595
time to testing your code.

43
00:01:48.595 --> 00:01:51.630
Testing makes sure your
code functions correctly,

44
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.190
interacts smoothly with other
parts of the application,

45
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.080
and meets user
experience standards.

46
00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.490
You'll conduct different
types of tests,

47
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.550
such as unit tests for
specific sections of code,

48
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.195
integration tests to ensure
parts work together,

49
00:02:06.195 --> 00:02:08.530
and user interface
test to confirm

50
00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.280
the site behaves correctly
in real-world conditions.

51
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.000
Debugging is another key task
for front-end engineers.

52
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.640
Once testing identifies
defects called bugs,

53
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.020
debugging involves
finding the root cause

54
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.240
of these issues and
correcting them.

55
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.460
This process often requires
a detailed code evaluation,

56
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.860
using debugging tools to
observe where things go

57
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.025
wrong and making the
necessary adjustments.

58
00:02:35.025 --> 00:02:37.220
Finally, as a
front-end engineer,

59
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.265
you'll collaborate
with team members.

60
00:02:39.265 --> 00:02:42.225
You'll work closely with
back-end developers,

61
00:02:42.225 --> 00:02:45.320
UX/UI designers,
project managers,

62
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.460
and clients to make sure
the final product meets

63
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.435
all requirements and delivers
a seamless user experience.

64
00:02:52.435 --> 00:02:56.480
How do front-end engineers
collaborate with team members?

65
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.060
Let's begin with how they

66
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.610
collaborate with
back-end developers.

67
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.420
Front-end engineers

68
00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.160
collaborate with
back-end developers to

69
00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.140
integrate the user interface
with back-end development,

70
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.150
such as databases,
APIs, and server logic.

71
00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.360
For instance, a front-end
engineer must collaborate with

72
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.160
a back-end engineer
to ensure that

73
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.360
when a user fills
out a booking form,

74
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.040
the responses are correctly

75
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.300
processed by the server and
stored in the database.

76
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.460
Front-end engineers also

77
00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.995
collaborate with
UX/UI designers.

78
00:03:27.995 --> 00:03:29.940
Front-end developers translate

79
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.685
design mock-ups into
functional code.

80
00:03:32.685 --> 00:03:35.360
They frequently have
discussions to align

81
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.920
on design specifications
and practicality,

82
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.780
followed by iterative feedback

83
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.380
sessions where developers build

84
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.560
prototypes and
designers evaluate

85
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.510
them for usability and
interactive accuracy.

86
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.215
For example, a front-end

87
00:03:48.215 --> 00:03:49.720
engineer might
regularly meet with

88
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.780
a UX/UI designer to ensure
that the forms buttons,

89
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.460
fields, and colors match

90
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.020
the designers requirements and

91
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.050
provide an intuitive
user experience.

92
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.640
They must also collaborate
with project managers.

93
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.160
Project managers help
front-end developers

94
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.080
by defining project scopes,

95
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.120
setting realistic deadlines,

96
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.615
and managing resources
efficiently.

97
00:04:11.615 --> 00:04:13.620
Front-end engineers might meet

98
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.000
with project managers during

99
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.740
a daily stand up or send them

100
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.760
a quick chat message to
update them on their status.

101
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.660
Finally, front-end engineers

102
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.340
must collaborate with clients.

103
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.680
Clients might be
internal stakeholders,

104
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.980
such as project managers
or marketing teams,

105
00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.940
or they might be
external clients

106
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.615
for whom a developer
is building a website.

107
00:04:32.615 --> 00:04:35.610
This collaboration involves
regular communication

108
00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.230
to understand client needs,

109
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.450
receive feedback, and adjust

110
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.795
the code based on that feedback.

111
00:04:41.795 --> 00:04:44.130
For example, a
front-end engineer

112
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.290
might demonstrate new
features to clients,

113
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:47.970
get their feedback,
and implement

114
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.370
changes to enhance the platform.

115
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.800
Why all these tasks?

116
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.510
A front-end engineer's
regular tasks,

117
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.550
coding, testing, debugging,

118
00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.710
and collaborating, all add up to

119
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.675
one big goal: creating a
great user experience.

120
00:05:03.675 --> 00:05:05.415
Every line of code,

121
00:05:05.415 --> 00:05:06.670
each bug fixed,

122
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.170
and all the teamwork aim
to make websites and apps

123
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:11.600
that not only work well

124
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.260
but also look and
feel good to use.

125
00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.590
When front-end engineers code,

126
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.695
they craft the parts of the
app users interact with.

127
00:05:19.695 --> 00:05:21.910
They test to ensure
everything works as

128
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.830
planned and debug to
smooth out any issues.

129
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.150
Plus, their collaboration
with designers and

130
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.755
clients keeps everything
user-focused.

131
00:05:29.755 --> 00:05:32.930
This isn't just about making
sure the site looks good.

132
00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.950
It's about optimizing
performance

133
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.290
to ensure a great
user experience.

134
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.290
Their work directly affects

135
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.010
how everyone
experiences the web,

136
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.925
making it faster, more
intuitive, and more enjoyable.

137
00:05:44.925 --> 00:05:47.720
In this video, you learned
about the key tasks

138
00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.215
and responsibilities of
a front-end engineer.

139
00:05:50.215 --> 00:05:52.660
Front-end engineers
have diverse tasks

140
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.340
crucial for creating functional,

141
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.345
beautiful, and
user-friendly applications.

142
00:05:57.345 --> 00:06:00.980
By mastering coding,
testing, debugging,

143
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.180
and collaboration,
they contribute

144
00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.180
significantly to the success
of any digital project.
