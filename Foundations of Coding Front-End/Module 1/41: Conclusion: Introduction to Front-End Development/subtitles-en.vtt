1
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.360
Front-end development is
essential for creating

2
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.720
interactive and visually
appealing web experiences.

3
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.480
Mastering its core
principles, tools,

4
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.415
and workflows is crucial
for building successful,

5
00:00:19.415 --> 00:00:22.155
user-friendly websites
and applications.

6
00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:24.040
We began by introducing

7
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.370
the fundamentals of front-end
development and explored

8
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:27.720
the critical practices and

9
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.640
principles that drive
successful projects.

10
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.580
Next, we examined the roles and

11
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.360
duties of a front-end engineer,

12
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.160
discuss the vital skills
and technologies needed,

13
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.400
and learn how to manage

14
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.540
the workflow in this
fast-paced field.

15
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.500
Then we moved on to
the fundamentals

16
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.800
of front-end project planning,

17
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.600
covering crucial techniques
and integrating tools and

18
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.125
strategies to ensure smooth
and successful execution.

19
00:00:50.125 --> 00:00:51.990
Next, you learned
how to carry out

20
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.730
front-end development tasks from

21
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.670
identifying and assigning tasks,

22
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.890
to managing workflows
efficiently.

23
00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.330
Next, we explore the basics
of version control systems,

24
00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.230
focusing on Git and GitHub,

25
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.750
and how they improve
collaboration

26
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.075
in front-end
development projects.

27
00:01:07.075 --> 00:01:09.590
Congratulations.
You have completed

28
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.270
Introduction to
Front-End Development.
