00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.940
Ever lost work or struggled
to collaborate on a project,

2
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.900
enter Git, the
lifesaver of coding.

3
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.340
This powerful version
control system

4
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.000
keeps track of every change,

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.180
making teamwork smooth
and mistakes fixable.

6
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.180
In this video, we will describe

7
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.920
the basics of Git commands,

8
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.260
and their uses in
front end development.

9
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.040
Let's start by reviewing the
benefits of version control.

10
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.480
Version control is
essential because it

11
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.740
tracks all changes
made to the code,

12
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.300
allows developers
to collaborate,

13
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.920
enables easy reversion
to previous versions,

14
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.100
and lets developers work
a new features or fixes,

15
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.440
without affecting
the main code base.

16
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.180
Though there are other
version control systems,

17
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.495
Git is the one that's
most widely used.

18
00:00:53.495 --> 00:00:56.450
Git is a distributed
version control system

19
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.530
that helps developers
track changes,

20
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.970
collaborate, and maintain
the history of their code.

21
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.490
Think of Git as one of
the essential tools

22
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:05.850
every developer needs,

23
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.290
like brushes and
palettes to a painter,

24
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.890
which helps them create and

25
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.310
manage different
versions of their work.

26
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.250
In contrast, GitHub is like

27
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.690
an art gallery where
artists store their pieces,

28
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.135
showcase their work, and
collaborate with other artists.

29
00:01:20.135 --> 00:01:22.630
How does get enable developers

30
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.370
to maintain the
history of their code,

31
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.415
track changes, and collaborate?

32
00:01:26.415 --> 00:01:29.810
Git involves the use of
repositories and branching.

33
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.705
Let's examine how Git uses
both of these strategies.

34
00:01:33.705 --> 00:01:36.150
In Git, a repository is

35
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.290
a storage space where

36
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.810
all files related to
a project are kept,

37
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.710
including their complete
change history.

38
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.070
These repositories hold
snapshots of all code versions,

39
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.530
allowing developers
to track changes,

40
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.770
maintain a history, and roll

41
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.770
back to a previous
version, if necessary.

42
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.910
Next, let's explore branching.

43
00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.330
If you think of the main
code as the main branch,

44
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.270
developers create other
branches when they need to add

45
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.970
new code or make changes
to the existing code.

46
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.770
Think of branching like
making a copy of a folder.

47
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.810
When a new branch is created,

48
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.950
it's like making a copy.

49
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.050
Developers can add to, modify,

50
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.650
and test these
documents in this copy,

51
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.080
without impacting the original.

52
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.490
Once they're sure their edits
are correct and stable,

53
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.370
they can merge the changes

54
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.970
into the folder back
into the main branch,

55
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.460
updating it with all
the new modifications.

56
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.550
Developers use
repositories and branching

57
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.770
to manage their code with
the help of Git in GitHub.

58
00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.970
But how do developers
interact with these tools?

59
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.020
They execute commands.

60
00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.710
Developers execute
commands typically through

61
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.860
an application like GitHub
or Visual Studio Code.

62
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.690
Some of the basic commands
developers use include clone,

63
00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.530
branch, commit, push, and pull.

64
00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.610
Let's explore each
of these commands

65
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.735
in detail, starting with clone.

66
00:03:04.735 --> 00:03:07.310
The clone command
creates a local copy

67
00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.050
of the repository a
developer is working on.

68
00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.230
This allows them
to start working

69
00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.650
with the code base on
their own machine.

70
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.810
To use the clone command,

71
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.770
you would type git, space, clone, space, then
the URL of the repository.

72
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.630
For instance, if you're
developing a new feature for

73
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.270
the shopping cart user interface

74
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.030
on an e-commerce website,

75
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.190
you would first clone
the existing project.

76
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.080
Next, you need to create

77
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.720
a branch using the
branch command.

78
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.380
The branch command allows
developers to create

79
00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.760
a new branch to work on a
specific feature or fix.

80
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.800
Working on branches keeps
the main code base stable.

81
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.760
To use the branch command,

82
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.755
you would type git, space, branch, space, then
the name of the branch.

83
00:03:53.755 --> 00:03:56.500
For your shopping cart
user interface feature,

84
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.020
you might create
a branch by using

85
00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.920
the command git branch
feature-shopping-cart-ui.

86
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.260
With a copy of the repository on

87
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.780
your local machine
and a branch created,

88
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.920
you're now ready to get started
on the development work.

89
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.180
Once you write some code or make

90
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.140
some code changes to
the existing code,

91
00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.130
you will commit your code.

92
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.260
The commit command captures

93
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.640
a snapshot of the
project's changes.

94
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.960
This allows you to
track your progress and

95
00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.670
revert to a previous
version if needed.

96
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.720
To use the commit command,

97
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.930
you would type git, space, commit, space, -m,

98
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.615
then a commit message in quotes.

99
00:04:36.615 --> 00:04:38.600
Notice that the commit command

100
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.000
includes the commit message.

101
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.880
This is where a developer
writes a meaningful message to

102
00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.125
describe what changes were
made to the code base.

103
00:04:47.125 --> 00:04:49.020
For example, after creating

104
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.900
the basic layout for
the shopping cart,

105
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.520
you might commit
with the message,

106
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.300
initialized shopping
cart layout.

107
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.860
When you're done with
all of your changes,

108
00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.690
you use the push command.

109
00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.500
The push command updates

110
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.940
the remote repository
with local changes,

111
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.980
allowing others to
review and use updates.

112
00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.960
To use the push command,

113
00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.630
you would type git, space, push, space,

114
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.360
then the name of the
remote repository,

115
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.575
and finally, the branch name.

116
00:05:17.575 --> 00:05:19.990
Once you're satisfied
with the development

117
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.110
and testing of your new
shopping cart feature,

118
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.510
the next step is to share

119
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.800
your work by pushing
it to GitHub.

120
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.995
You execute the command git

121
00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:32.880
push origin
feature-shopping-cart-ui,

122
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.530
which uploads all commands
from your local branch

123
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.620
named feature-shopping-cart-ui
to GitHub.

124
00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.750
Now you're ready to
start working on

125
00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.965
the next feature so you could
execute a pull command.

126
00:05:44.965 --> 00:05:47.730
The pull command updates
your local code base

127
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.510
with the latest changes
from the remote repository,

128
00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.310
ensuring you have the
most current version.

129
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.410
To use the pull command,

130
00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.715
you would type git, space, pull, space,

131
00:05:58.715 --> 00:06:01.530
then the name of the
remote repository,

132
00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.550
and finally, the branch name.

133
00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.870
You use the pull command
git pull origin main,

134
00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.450
to pull down the latest version

135
00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:11.685
of the code in the repository.

136
00:06:11.685 --> 00:06:14.200
After pulling the
latest updates,

137
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.280
you can go back and use
the branch command.

138
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.100
This will create
a new branch from

139
00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.020
the updated main branch,

140
00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.690
so you can start working
on your next feature.

141
00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.440
This workflow maintains
the integrity

142
00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.000
and continuity of the project,

143
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.480
allowing all developers to

144
00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.260
work collaboratively
and efficiently.

145
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.530
In this video, you learn some of

146
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:37.750
the basic Git commands and

147
00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:39.990
their uses in the
development process.

148
00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.110
By mastering basic Git
commands such as clone,

149
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.470
branch, commit, push, and pull,

150
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.290
developers can effectively
manage their code,

151
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:49.750
collaborate with their team,

152
00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.810
and maintain a comprehensive
history of their projects.

153
00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.690
This leads to a more organized

154
00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:57.270
and efficient
development process.
