2
00:00:07.636 --> 00:00:11.821
Welcome to the foundations
of coding front-end course.

3
00:00:11.821 --> 00:00:16.220
This course will equip you with key
skills in front-end development,

4
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:21.646
including fundamental principles,
project planning, logical problem-solving,

5
00:00:21.646 --> 00:00:25.621
and the use of algorithms,
control structures and functions.

6
00:00:25.621 --> 00:00:29.274
You'll gain practical experience
creating efficient and

7
00:00:29.274 --> 00:00:34.249
dynamic web solutions, setting you up for
success in front-end development.

8
00:00:34.249 --> 00:00:38.258
We'll start by covering the core
principles of front-end development and

9
00:00:38.258 --> 00:00:40.144
the role of front-end engineers.

10
00:00:40.144 --> 00:00:44.914
You'll learn how to plan front-end
projects, understand key tasks, and

11
00:00:44.914 --> 00:00:49.830
use Git and GitHub for version control,
including creating a project plan and

12
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.730
repository.

13
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.190
Next, we'll explore logical processes and
their role in programming.

14
00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.718
You'll apply deductive reasoning,
break down complex problems and

15
00:01:00.718 --> 00:01:03.633
practice top-down and
bottom-up strategies,

16
00:01:03.633 --> 00:01:07.407
including writing pseudocode for
different scenarios.

17
00:01:07.407 --> 00:01:12.099
Then we'll cover algorithm structures,
including if/then statements and

18
00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:13.030
binary logic.

19
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.843
You'll use flowcharts to map out logical
steps, identify key data types, and

20
00:01:18.843 --> 00:01:24.587
learn to declare variables in C#
while implementing a simple algorithm.

21
00:01:24.587 --> 00:01:29.000
Next, we'll define basic control
structures like if-else statements and

22
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.371
switch cases, and
see how they handle decision making.

23
00:01:32.371 --> 00:01:36.468
We'll then cover loops-such as for
while and do-while- and

24
00:01:36.468 --> 00:01:39.485
their role in managing repetitive tasks.

25
00:01:39.485 --> 00:01:44.471
Finally, you'll practice combining
these elements in coding exercises.

26
00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:49.505
Next, we will explore using functions
to create reusable cold blocks and

27
00:01:49.505 --> 00:01:55.202
understand methods in C#, including
their definition, syntax and use cases.

28
00:01:55.202 --> 00:01:59.982
You will learn to call methods and handle
parameters to pass data effectively.

29
00:01:59.982 --> 00:02:04.626
Finally, we will develop simple
programs that utilize functions and

30
00:02:04.626 --> 00:02:06.523
methods to solve problems.

31
00:02:06.523 --> 00:02:11.023
Finally, you will apply the concepts,
strategies and skills learned

32
00:02:11.023 --> 00:02:15.523
throughout the course to develop
a code project with heat components,

33
00:02:15.523 --> 00:02:21.000
including if/else statements, loops,
conditionals, functions and variables.

34
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.533
Throughout this course, you will
acquire fundamental skills in front-end

35
00:02:25.533 --> 00:02:30.206
development, including project planning,
logical problem-solving, and

36
00:02:30.206 --> 00:02:32.801
using algorithms and control structures.

37
00:02:32.801 --> 00:02:35.740
You will be proficient in
applying functions and

38
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.828
methods to build dynamic
web solutions by the end.

39
00:02:38.828 --> 00:02:42.693
We look forward to supporting you as
you develop your front-end development

40
00:02:42.693 --> 00:02:46.148
expertise, and successfully create
efficient web applications.
