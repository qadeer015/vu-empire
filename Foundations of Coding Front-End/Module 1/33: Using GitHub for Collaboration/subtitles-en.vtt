2
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.979
Suppose you just joined a large team to
begin work developing a financial services

3
00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:13.630
application.

4
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:18.455
Your team has to create features such
as signup flows, user authentication,

5
00:00:18.455 --> 00:00:22.050
overview of account balances,
bill payment, and more.

6
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.575
Your team is using GitHub as a version
control system where everyone

7
00:00:26.575 --> 00:00:30.710
can collaborate and contribute to
the project seamlessly, track changes, and

8
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.680
review each other's work efficiently.

9
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.180
In this video, we will summarize the
process of setting up a GitHub repository.

10
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.800
GitHub is more than just
a place to store code.

11
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.021
It enables collaboration through
the lifecycle of a project,

12
00:00:46.021 --> 00:00:50.560
making sure that everyone's
contributions fit together seamlessly.

13
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.780
Let's review some of the benefits
of using GitHub for collaboration.

14
00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.100
Instead of developers working in isolation
and trying to merge their work at the end,

15
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.806
a process prone to conflicts and errors,
GitHub allows developers to continuously

16
00:01:04.806 --> 00:01:09.070
observe and integrate the team's work,
ensuring seamless integration.

17
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.683
It also allows them to share resources
such as common libraries, tools and

18
00:01:14.683 --> 00:01:19.230
code snippets to increase efficiency and
consistency across the project.

19
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.085
GitHub also helps the team follow
clear workflows for coding, reviewing,

20
00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:26.600
testing, and building.

21
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.220
But how exactly do developers
use GitHub for collaboration?

22
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.984
They employ some common
collaborative actions,

23
00:01:34.984 --> 00:01:38.060
starting with creating a repository.

24
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.660
Next, you'll manage branches to keep
different features or fixes organized.

25
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.102
Then you'll submit pull requests
to propose changes, and finally,

26
00:01:46.102 --> 00:01:50.430
you'll conduct code reviews to ensure
everything is working as it should.

27
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.490
Let's examine each of
these in more detail.

28
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.240
To start a new project on GitHub, you need
to create a repository that will store

29
00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.410
your project files and version history.

30
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.337
Creating a repository
involves logging into GitHub,

31
00:02:05.337 --> 00:02:09.970
navigating to the repository section,
and selecting the new button.

32
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.682
You will need to provide a name for
your repository, an optional description,

33
00:02:15.682 --> 00:02:18.940
and choose whether it will be public or
private.

34
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.798
For example, you might start a new project
by creating a repository named financial

35
00:02:23.798 --> 00:02:27.920
web app on GitHub, making it public so
others can view and contribute.

36
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.036
Once you create a repository,
development can begin and

37
00:02:32.036 --> 00:02:34.080
you will create and manage branches.

38
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.105
Your team will develop on branches, which
allows you to work on different features

39
00:02:40.105 --> 00:02:43.800
or fixes independently before
merging them into the main codebase.

40
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.860
To create a branch,
navigate to your repository on GitHub and

41
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.080
use the branch drop-down
menu to create a new branch.

42
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.153
Naming conventions often
include the feature or

43
00:02:56.153 --> 00:02:59.692
fix being worked on for
your financial services application.

44
00:02:59.692 --> 00:03:03.824
You might create a branch for the new
feature login flow to ensure the main

45
00:03:03.824 --> 00:03:06.668
branch remains stable and
production ready.

46
00:03:06.668 --> 00:03:11.156
After doing some development work, you
want to add your work to the main branch.

47
00:03:11.156 --> 00:03:15.620
You submit a pull request to propose
the changes you've made in a branch to be

48
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.520
merged into the main codebase.

49
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.924
After committing changes to a branch,

50
00:03:20.924 --> 00:03:25.600
navigate to the pull request tab in your
repository and select new pull request.

51
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.367
You can then compare
changes across branches and

52
00:03:29.367 --> 00:03:32.780
provide a description of
the proposed changes.

53
00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.466
For instance, you submit a pull request to
merge your login flow branch into the main

54
00:03:37.466 --> 00:03:42.110
branch, describing the new login
functionality you've implemented.

55
00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.110
Finally, it's time to have
a colleague review your work.

56
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.939
You initiate a code review that involves a
team member reviewing changes proposed in

57
00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:55.170
a pull request to ensure code quality and
functionality before merging.

58
00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.600
Reviewing a pull request involves
checking the code for errors and for

59
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.680
standards, as well as for
overall functionality.

60
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.190
Reviewers can comment on specific lines,
suggest changes, and

61
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.145
approve the pull request once satisfied.

62
00:04:12.145 --> 00:04:16.463
Your team members review your login flow
pull request while you get a code review

63
00:04:16.463 --> 00:04:20.791
request from another team member working
on the user authentication feature.

64
00:04:20.791 --> 00:04:25.162
You notice that the code lacks error
handling for potential issues like null

65
00:04:25.162 --> 00:04:29.340
inputs or invalid user data, so
you add this as a comment in your review.

66
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.537
This code review helps maintain high code
quality and allows you to share knowledge.

67
00:04:40.028 --> 00:04:44.880
In this video, we summarize the process
of setting up a GitHub repository.

68
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.653
By setting up and
using GitHub repositories,

69
00:04:47.653 --> 00:04:52.063
development teams can effectively
collaborate, manage code changes,

70
00:04:52.063 --> 00:04:54.930
and maintain a high quality codebase.

71
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.268
This enhances productivity and
ensures successful project outcomes.

72
00:04:59.268 --> 00:04:59.768
