1
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.448
Front-end engineering projects have
specific project stages that ensure

2
00:00:11.448 --> 00:00:15.150
development projects are done
efficiently and effectively.

3
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.257
In this video, we will describe the scope
of front-end engineering projects and

4
00:00:19.257 --> 00:00:21.410
the workflow involved in executing them.

5
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.970
Let's start by exploring the stages
of a front-end development project.

6
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.886
These projects typically follow a series
of stages that include initial planning

7
00:00:31.886 --> 00:00:35.850
and design, development,
testing, and deployment.

8
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.210
The initial planning and design stage
is where developers begin their work.

9
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.271
They start by gathering requirements,
defining objectives,

10
00:00:44.271 --> 00:00:47.010
and creating design mockups.

11
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.598
This stage also involves collaboration
with stakeholders to ensure the project

12
00:00:51.598 --> 00:00:52.750
meets users needs.

13
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.177
Good planning and design ensures
a successful project by ensuring everyone

14
00:00:58.177 --> 00:01:00.790
involved has a clear
vision of the end product.

15
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.410
Next comes the development stage,
which is where the actual coding happens.

16
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.459
Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript,
engineers bring the designs to life,

17
00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:16.850
creating interactive and
responsive web pages.

18
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.190
During this stage, it's crucial to follow
best practices in coding to ensure that

19
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.930
the code is clean,
efficient, and maintainable.

20
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.902
Testing follows development.

21
00:01:26.902 --> 00:01:29.983
Testing is critical because
it helps identify and

22
00:01:29.983 --> 00:01:33.070
fix bugs before the project goes live.

23
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:39.430
This includes unit testing, integration
testing, and user acceptance testing.

24
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.705
Engineers use testing frameworks to write
tests that ensure the code works as

25
00:01:43.705 --> 00:01:44.370
expected.

26
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.460
After testing, it's time for deployment.

27
00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.020
Deployment is the process of
releasing the final product to users.

28
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.379
This involves transferring code to a live
server where it can be accessed by

29
00:01:57.379 --> 00:01:58.080
end users.

30
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.908
Effective deployment strategies
ensure that an application is

31
00:02:02.908 --> 00:02:05.443
reliably available and perform, as well.

32
00:02:05.443 --> 00:02:09.586
At every stage in the process,
front-end developers collaborate and

33
00:02:09.586 --> 00:02:12.660
communicate with back-end developers.

34
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.911
This collaboration is essential
to ensure that the front-end and

35
00:02:15.911 --> 00:02:18.730
back-end systems work together seamlessly.

36
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.153
We call this ‘integration’, and
it's the goal of front-end and

37
00:02:22.153 --> 00:02:23.710
back-end collaboration.

38
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.586
Front-end interfaces
don't exist in isolation.

39
00:02:28.586 --> 00:02:33.490
They must integrate with back-end
systems such as databases and APIs.

40
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.420
An API, or
Application Programming Interface,

41
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.650
allows different software applications
to communicate with each other.

42
00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.848
For instance,
when a user submits a form on a website,

43
00:02:44.848 --> 00:02:49.400
an API might be used to send that
data to a server for processing.

44
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.316
Collaboration between
front-end engineers and

45
00:02:52.316 --> 00:02:57.041
back-end engineers often include regular
meetings and clear documentation.

46
00:02:57.041 --> 00:03:00.272
To manage the project stages and
the collaboration,

47
00:03:00.272 --> 00:03:02.580
teams adopt a workflow methodology.

48
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.782
Workflow methodologies are structured
approaches used to organize and

49
00:03:07.782 --> 00:03:10.420
manage the steps and
tasks involved in a project.

50
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.096
Different methodologies provide
various frameworks for collaboration,

51
00:03:16.096 --> 00:03:18.580
task management, and project tracking.

52
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.940
There are several workflow
methodologies to choose from,

53
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.584
each with its own strengths and
weaknesses.

54
00:03:25.584 --> 00:03:30.324
Waterfall methodology is a linear approach
in which each stage of the project must be

55
00:03:30.324 --> 00:03:33.480
completed before proceeding to the next.

56
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.580
This approach is straightforward,
but it can also be inflexible.

57
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.090
Another workflow methodology is XP,
or Extreme Programming.

58
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.782
This methodology emphasizes frequent
releases, continuous feedback, and

59
00:03:46.782 --> 00:03:50.490
close collaboration between developers and
users.

60
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.177
XP focuses on improving
software quality and

61
00:03:53.177 --> 00:03:55.870
responsiveness to changing requirements.

62
00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.115
Agile methodology, however,

63
00:03:59.115 --> 00:04:03.150
is particularly popular
in front-end engineering.

64
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.294
Agile is an iterative approach
that promotes flexibility and

65
00:04:06.294 --> 00:04:08.270
customer collaboration.

66
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:13.103
In Agile, projects are divided into
smaller, manageable chunks called sprints,

67
00:04:13.103 --> 00:04:15.910
typically lasting two to four weeks.

68
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.250
At the end of each sprint, the team
reviews progress and plans the next steps.

69
00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.856
Agile methodologies allow front-end
engineers to adapt quickly to changes and

70
00:04:25.856 --> 00:04:28.850
continuously improve their
work based on feedback.

71
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.352
To manage the project stages efficiently
and develop an excellent product,

72
00:04:34.352 --> 00:04:37.370
front-end engineers follow
some best practices.

73
00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.550
First, front-end engineers
must prioritize their tasks.

74
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.190
They organize tasks based on
their importance and deadlines.

75
00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.816
They use project management
tools like JIRA, Trello, or

76
00:04:49.816 --> 00:04:54.320
Asana to help manage and
prioritize tasks efficiently.

77
00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.778
They also use version control
tools to manage code changes and

78
00:04:57.778 --> 00:05:00.160
collaborate effectively.

79
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.320
Code reviews are another
important practice.

80
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.291
Code reviews involve having other
developers review your code to catch

81
00:05:07.291 --> 00:05:12.000
errors, improve code quality, and
share knowledge with the team.

82
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.694
This enables engineers to
maintain code quality and

83
00:05:14.694 --> 00:05:17.160
share knowledge among team members.

84
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.560
Finally, they implement deployment
strategies such as continuous integration

85
00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.950
and continuous deployment pipelines,
CI/CD, to automate the deployment process.

86
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.590
This ensures that updates
are deployed frequently and reliably.

87
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.535
In this video, you learned about the scope
of front-end engineering projects and

88
00:05:35.535 --> 00:05:38.590
some key best practices for
workflow management.

89
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.643
Understanding the scope and workflow of
front-end engineering projects is critical

90
00:05:42.643 --> 00:05:45.710
for delivering high
quality web applications.

91
00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:50.542
By following structured project stages,
collaborating with back-end engineers to

92
00:05:50.542 --> 00:05:55.307
seamlessly integrate with back-end
systems, and adhering to best practices,

93
00:05:55.307 --> 00:06:00.359
front-end engineers can create efficient,
user friendly, and robust applications.
